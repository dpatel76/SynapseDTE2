# Scoping Decision Buttons Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Current Credit limit" attribute in the Scoping phase was not showing the Include/Exclude decision buttons for the tester role.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database State
- The "Current Credit limit" attribute had `tester_decision` as NULL, which is correct for undecided attributes
- The decision buttons should appear when `tester_decision` is NULL

### 2. Frontend Logic  
The frontend code correctly shows buttons when:
```tsx
{(!attr.tester_decision || attr.tester_decision === null) && !attr.is_primary_key && !isReadOnly() && (
```

### 3. The Real Issue: Backend Errors
The page was in read-only mode because the scoping status endpoints were failing with 500 errors:

#### Error 1: Type Handling
```python
# In scoping_service.py line 142
"version_status": version.version_status.value  # Failed because version_status is already a string
```

#### Error 2: Typos in Enum Values
```python
ReportOwnerDecision.APPROVEDD    # Should be APPROVED
ReportOwnerDecision.REJECTEDED   # Should be REJECTED
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed version_status type handling
```python
# Added type checking to handle both string and enum types
"version_status": version.version_status if isinstance(version.version_status, str) else (version.version_status.value if version.version_status else "draft")
```

### 2. Fixed enum typos
- Changed all occurrences of `APPROVEDD` to `APPROVED`
- Changed all occurrences of `REJECTEDED` to `REJECTED`

## Result
After the fixes:
1. All scoping endpoints return 200 OK
2. The phase status shows it's editable (`can_be_edited: True`)
3. The page should no longer be in read-only mode
4. The Include/Exclude buttons should now appear for attributes with NULL tester_decision

## Next Steps
1. Refresh the Scoping page in the browser
2. The "Current Credit limit" attribute should now show the Include/Exclude buttons
3. The page should be fully interactive (not read-only)

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check that the scoping status endpoint returns 200: `/api/v1/scoping/cycles/55/reports/156/status`
2. Check that `can_be_edited` is `true` in the current version endpoint
3. Look for the green checkmark and red X buttons next to the "Current Credit limit" attribute
