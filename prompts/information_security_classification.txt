Suggest information security classification for the given Process Data Element (PDE).

CONTEXT:
- Report: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Context: ${regulatory_context}

PDE TO CLASSIFY:
- PDE Name: ${pde_name}
- PDE Code: ${pde_code}
- Description: ${pde_description}
- Business Process: ${business_process}
- Source System: ${source_system}

RELATED ATTRIBUTE DETAILS:
- Attribute Name: ${attribute_name}
- Data Type: ${data_type}
- Is CDE: ${cde_flag}
- Is Primary Key: ${is_primary_key}
- Has Historical Issues: ${historical_issues_flag}
- Validation Rules: ${validation_rules}

CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

1. CRITICALITY (Business Impact):
   - HIGH: Essential for core business operations, regulatory reporting
   - MEDIUM: Important but not critical, has workarounds
   - LOW: Nice to have, minimal business impact

2. RISK LEVEL (Security/Compliance Risk):
   - HIGH: Contains PII/sensitive data, regulatory penalties for breach
   - MEDIUM: Confidential business data, moderate impact
   - LOW: Public or non-sensitive information

3. INFORMATION SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
   - HRCI (Highly Restricted Confidential Information): Most sensitive data requiring highest protection (e.g., SSN, account numbers, credit scores)
   - Confidential: Sensitive business/customer data requiring protection (e.g., customer names, addresses, internal strategies)
   - Proprietary: Internal business information not for public disclosure (e.g., business processes, internal metrics)
   - Public: Information that can be freely shared (e.g., published reports, marketing materials)

4. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS:
   - Identify applicable regulations
   - Note specific compliance requirements
   - Consider data retention rules

5. PII/SENSITIVE DATA FLAGS:
   - Personal Identifiable Information
   - Financial account data
   - Health information
   - Proprietary business data

Please classify this PDE considering:
1. Data sensitivity and privacy requirements
2. Regulatory compliance obligations
3. Business criticality
4. Security breach impact
5. Historical issues or audit findings
