## Mortgage Specific Extraction Guidelines
1. **Loan Identification**: Use loan number as primary identifier, verify property address matches
2. **Rate Types**: Distinguish between note rate, current rate, and APR
3. **Balance Types**: Differentiate between original loan amount, current principal balance, and payoff amount
4. **Property Details**: Extract complete address including unit numbers for condos
5. **Date Formats**: Convert various date formats to YYYYMMDD for FR Y-14M
6. **Borrower Information**: Handle multiple borrowers and co-borrower scenarios
7. **Payment Information**: Identify P&I vs total payment including escrow

## Confidence Scoring for Mortgage Data
- **0.9-1.0**: Exact match with clear mortgage context and correct loan identifier
- **0.7-0.8**: High confidence with standard mortgage terminology
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate confidence, some interpretation of mortgage terms required
- **0.3-0.4**: Low confidence, ambiguous mortgage data presentation
- **0.0-0.2**: No clear match or wrong loan/property

## Mortgage Data Quality Flags
- "multiple_loans_found": Document contains multiple mortgage loans
- "rate_type_unclear": Cannot determine if rate is note rate or APR
- "balance_includes_escrow": Balance may include escrow amounts
- "property_address_incomplete": Missing unit number or zip code
- "refinance_detected": Loan appears to be a refinance affecting original date/amount
- "modification_indicated": Loan terms may have been modified
- "arm_rate_reset": Adjustable rate mortgage with recent rate change

## Search Strategy for Mortgage Documents
1. Look for loan summary or servicing statement sections
2. Check mortgage note for original loan terms
3. Identify payment history tables for current balance
4. Look for escrow analysis for total payment amounts
5. Check correspondence headers for loan and property identifiers
6. Verify delinquency notices for days past due status

Please extract the requested mortgage attribute value with careful attention to FR Y-14M Schedule A.1 requirements and mortgage industry standards.
