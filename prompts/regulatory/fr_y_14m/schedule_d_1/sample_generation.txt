- Payment Amount: $0 - $50,000
- Days Past Due: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120+
- Months on Books: 1 - 240 months

**Risk Indicators**:
- FICO Score: 300 - 850
- Payment Rate: 0% - 100%
- Utilization Rate: 0% - 100%
- Probability of Default: 0.1% - 25%

**Account Characteristics**:
- Interest Rate (APR): 8.99% - 29.99%
- Product Type: Standard, Rewards, Secured, Business
- Account Status: Open, Closed, Charged Off, Bankruptcy

## Dynamic JSON Output Structure

**Scoped Attributes to Include:**
{scoped_attributes}

Generate exactly {sample_size} samples in the following JSON array format:

```json
[
  {
    "sample_id": "FRY14M-D1-001", 
    "sample_data": {
      {attribute_fields}
    },
    "account_profile": "performing|stressed|delinquent|new|edge_case",
    "risk_scenario": "baseline|adverse|severely_adverse",
    "testing_rationale": "Specific stress testing objective for this loan",
    "compliance_notes": "How this sample tests FR Y-14M D.1 requirements"
  }
]
```

**Required Sample Data Fields:**
For each sample, generate realistic values for these exact attribute names:
{attribute_details}

## Sample Value Generation Rules

### Core Loan Attributes
1. **Account Identifiers**:
   - Reference Number: 10-15 digit unique loan ID
   - Customer ID: 8-12 digit customer identifier
   - Bank ID: Valid RSSD ID (1000000-4999999)

2. **Balance and Limit Fields**:
   - Ensure mathematical consistency (balance ≤ credit limit)
   - Realistic utilization patterns by risk profile
   - Account for payment posting and interest accrual

3. **Payment Behavior**:
   - Payment rates consistent with delinquency status
   - Minimum payment calculations per regulatory standards
   - Historical payment patterns supporting risk classification

4. **Risk Metrics**:
   - FICO scores aligned with account performance
   - PD estimates consistent with portfolio experience
   - Loss given default assumptions per regulatory guidance

## Critical Testing Scenarios

Include samples that test:

### Stress Testing Requirements
1. **Baseline Economic Scenario**: Normal economic conditions, typical loss rates
2. **Adverse Economic Scenario**: Moderate economic stress, elevated losses
3. **Severely Adverse Scenario**: Severe recession, significant credit deterioration

### Portfolio Risk Coverage
1. **Credit Score Segmentation**: Prime, near-prime, subprime distributions
2. **Utilization Patterns**: Low, moderate, high utilization behaviors
3. **Seasoning Effects**: New accounts vs. mature account performance
4. **Product Mix**: Different card products and pricing tiers

### Regulatory Edge Cases
1. **Charge-off Timing**: 180+ days past due recognition
2. **Bankruptcy Treatment**: Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 13 impacts
3. **Credit Line Management**: Increases, decreases, suspensions
4. **Interest Rate Changes**: Promotional rates, penalty pricing

## Data Quality Requirements

Each sample must:
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: All calculations and relationships validated
- **Regulatory Consistency**: Align with FR Y-14M data definitions
- **Realistic Patterns**: Reflect actual credit card portfolio characteristics
- **Stress Test Relevance**: Support CCAR/DFAST loss estimation models
- **Data Privacy**: No real customer information, synthetic data only

## Output Validation Checks

Before finalizing samples:
1. **Balance Relationships**: Outstanding ≤ Credit Limit, Available = Limit - Outstanding
2. **Delinquency Logic**: Payment amounts consistent with past due status
3. **Risk Alignment**: FICO scores match performance indicators
4. **Temporal Consistency**: Account age supports payment history depth
5. **Regulatory Ratios**: Loss rates within expected stress test ranges

## Critical Instructions

1. **Replace ALL placeholder comments** in the sample_data section with actual realistic values
2. **Use the exact attribute names** from the scoped attributes list above
3. **Generate appropriate data types** - strings should be strings, numbers should be numbers
4. **Ensure regulatory compliance** - all values must be realistic for FR Y-14M Schedule D.1
5. **Vary the samples** - create different scenarios across performing/stressed/delinquent/new/edge cases
6. **No comments in final JSON** - output clean, parseable JSON only

Generate {sample_size} loan-level samples now as a JSON array, ensuring each sample contains realistic values for ALL scoped attributes and supports specific FR Y-14M Schedule D.1 stress testing requirements.

**Output only the JSON array - no additional text or explanations.**
