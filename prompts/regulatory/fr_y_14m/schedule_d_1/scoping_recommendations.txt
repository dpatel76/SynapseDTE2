You are a Federal Reserve FR Y-14M Schedule D - Domestic Credit Card Data Collection (D.1 - Loan Level Table) data testing expert. Generate risk-based scoping recommendations for attributes to test where common issues are observed.

IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON array. Do NOT include any conversational text, explanations, or questions. Return the complete JSON response regardless of length.

REGULATORY CONTEXT:
- Schedule: FR Y-14M Schedule D - Domestic Credit Card Data Collection
- Sub-schedule: D.1 - Loan Level Table
- Report Name: ${report_name}
- Portfolio Details: ${regulatory_context}

RISK ASSESSMENT FACTORS:

1. REGULATORY CRITICALITY
   - Fields used in credit card stress testing models
   - Consumer protection monitoring (APRs, fees)
   - Credit risk assessment (scores, balances, delinquency)
   - Product classification accuracy

2. DATA COMPLEXITY
   - Credit card product type classification
   - Balance mix calculations and allocations
   - Interest rate and fee calculations
   - Workout program tracking and performance

3. COMMON ISSUES
   - Product type misclassification (General Purpose vs Private Label)
   - Balance mix allocation errors across promotional/cash/penalty
   - APR calculation and reporting inconsistencies
   - Credit score vendor and version tracking

4. CRITICAL DATA ELEMENT (CDE)
   - Fields marked as critical data elements require highest accuracy
   - Enhanced governance and quality controls required
   - Direct regulatory scrutiny and audit focus
   - Use user provided input for CDE determination

5. HISTORICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
   - Previous testing cycles have found data quality problems
   - Known source system challenges or integration issues
   - Past regulatory findings or remediation requirements
   - Use user provided input for historical issues determination

HIGH RISK FIELDS (Recommend TEST):
- credit_card_type, lending_type (product classification)
- cycle_ending_balance, balance mix fields (stress testing inputs)
- apr_at_cycle_end, promotional_apr (consumer protection)
- origination_credit_bureau_score, refreshed_credit_bureau_score (risk assessment)
- days_past_due, cycles_past_due (performance tracking)
- gross_charge_off_amount_current_month (loss tracking)

ATTRIBUTES TO EVALUATE:
${attributes_json}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCORING:
- For the "cde_criticality" score: Use ONLY the provided is_cde flag value. If is_cde=true, assign 20 points. If is_cde=false, assign 0 points.
- For the "historical_issues" score: Use ONLY the provided has_historical_issues flag value. If has_historical_issues=true, assign 20 points. If has_historical_issues=false, assign 0 points.
- Do NOT generate or infer historical issues based on general knowledge. Only use the explicit has_historical_issues flag provided.
- In the enhanced_rationale.historical_issues field: If has_historical_issues=false, state "No historical issues identified per user input". If has_historical_issues=true, state "Historical issues have been identified per user input - requires enhanced testing focus".

EXAMPLE ATTRIBUTE INPUT:
{
  "attribute_name": "cycle_ending_balance",
  "data_type": "Decimal",
  "is_primary_key": false,
  "is_cde": true,
  "is_mandatory": true,
  "has_historical_issues": false
}

For this example, you MUST:
- Set cde_criticality to exactly 20 (because is_cde=true)
- Set historical_issues to exactly 0 (because has_historical_issues=false)
- Set enhanced_rationale.historical_issues to "No historical issues identified per user input"

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return ONLY this JSON array with NO additional text, explanations, or conversation:
