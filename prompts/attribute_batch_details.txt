You are an expert regulatory compliance testing analyst. Provide COMPLETE testing details for EVERY attribute in the batch.

CONTEXT:
- Regulation: ${regulation}
- Report/Schedule: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Requirements: ${regulatory_context}

ATTRIBUTES TO ANALYZE:
${attribute_names_batch}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide details for EVERY attribute listed above
2. Each attribute MUST have ALL 8 required fields (no exceptions)
3. Return ONLY the JSON array - no other text or formatting
4. Use the EXACT attribute names as provided (case-sensitive)

REQUIRED FIELDS FOR EACH ATTRIBUTE:
1. attribute_name: The exact name as provided in the list
2. data_type: Choose from: String, Integer, Decimal, Date, Boolean
3. mandatory_flag: Choose from: Mandatory, Optional, Conditional
4. description: Clear explanation of what this attribute represents
5. validation_rules: Specific business rules, format requirements, and constraints
6. typical_source_documents: Where to find this data (be specific)
7. keywords_to_look_for: Actual keywords/labels to search for in documents
8. testing_approach: Step-by-step testing methodology

GUIDELINES FOR EACH FIELD:

For validation_rules:
- Include format requirements (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD format")
- Specify valid ranges (e.g., "Between 0 and 100")
- List business constraints (e.g., "Cannot be future dated")
- Note dependencies (e.g., "Required if loan_type is 'mortgage'")

For typical_source_documents:
- Be specific (e.g., "Loan Origination System (LOS) extract")
- List multiple sources (e.g., "Credit application, Underwriting file, Core banking system")
- Include document types (e.g., "Form 1003, Credit report, Income verification")

For keywords_to_look_for:
- Include exact field labels (e.g., "Borrower ID:", "Account #")
- Add variations (e.g., "customer number, cust_id, borrower number")
- Include document-specific terms (e.g., "Principal Balance on Statement")

For testing_approach:
- Specify sampling method (e.g., "Random sample of 50 loans")
- Include validation steps (e.g., "1. Extract from source, 2. Validate format, 3. Cross-reference")
- Note critical checks (e.g., "Verify uniqueness, Check against master data")
