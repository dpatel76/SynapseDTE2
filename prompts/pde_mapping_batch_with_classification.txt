Map the following ${attributes_count} report attributes to database columns AND classify them for information security and regulatory compliance.

CONTEXT:
- Report: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Context: ${regulatory_context}

AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES WITH SCHEMA:
${data_sources}

ATTRIBUTES TO MAP AND CLASSIFY:
${attributes_json}

TASK 1 - MAPPING:
For each attribute, identify the most appropriate table and column from the ACTUAL DATABASE SCHEMA provided above.

CRITICAL MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST ONLY suggest columns that ACTUALLY EXIST in the schema_summary provided
- DO NOT use any knowledge about database schemas outside of what is explicitly provided
- DO NOT suggest system tables or columns (those starting with cycle_report_, activity_, workflow_, etc.)
- If you cannot find a suitable match in the provided schema, use null for source fields
- Look for column names that semantically match the attribute
- Consider data type compatibility
- For primary keys, prefer columns marked as (PK)

TASK 2 - CLASSIFICATION:
For each attribute, analyze for information security classification and regulatory compliance based on:
1. The attribute name and description
2. The data type and characteristics (PK, CDE, mandatory, etc.)
3. The regulatory context of the report
4. Common regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, etc.)

INFORMATION SECURITY CLASSIFICATIONS:
- HRCI: Highly Restricted Confidential Information (e.g., SSN, credit card numbers, sensitive PII)
- Confidential: Confidential business information (e.g., customer data, financial data)
- Proprietary: Proprietary company information (e.g., internal identifiers, business logic)
- Public: Public information (e.g., published reports, non-sensitive reference data)

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON object where each key is the attribute ID from the input and the value contains both mapping and classification:

{
  "attribute_id_1": {
    "data_source_id": number or null,
    "table_name": "exact table name from schema or null",
    "column_name": "exact column name from schema or null",
    "confidence": number (0-100),
    "reasoning": "Why this column from the schema is the best match",
    "transformation_rule": "direct|calculated|lookup|conditional",
    "business_process": "relevant business process",
    "information_security_classification": "HRCI|Confidential|Proprietary|Public",
    "criticality": "High|Medium|Low",
    "risk_level": "High|Medium|Low",
    "regulatory_flag": boolean,
    "pii_flag": boolean,
    "regulatory_references": ["List of applicable regulations"],
    "classification_rationale": "Detailed explanation of security classification",
    "llm_classification_confidence": number (0-100),
    "evidence": {
      "data_sensitivity_indicators": ["List of indicators"],
      "regulatory_scope": ["List of regulations"],
      "business_impact": "Description of impact"
    }
  },
  "attribute_id_2": {
    // ... same structure ...
  }
}

IMPORTANT:
- Process ALL ${attributes_count} attributes provided
- Each attribute ID in the input must have a corresponding entry in the output
- The source fields MUST come from the columns shown in the schema_summary above
- Consider the regulatory context when determining classification
- Flag any attributes that contain PII or are subject to regulatory requirements
- Provide clear rationale for both mapping and classification decisions
