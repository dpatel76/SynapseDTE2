  - Observations phase found: ✅ Success
  - Observation records: 0 (awaiting observation creation)

## Key Findings

### What Works:
1. **Universal Assignment System**: Successfully creates and manages assignments between roles
2. **Data Owner ID Phase**: Send to Data Executives functionality works correctly
3. **Database Structure**: All required tables exist with correct schemas
4. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints exist under their correct paths
5. **Phase Management**: All phases are properly created in the workflow

### Integration Notes:
1. **Activity Management**: Phase start/complete operations are handled through the activity management system, not individual phase endpoints
2. **Data Owner Assignment**: The actual mapping of data owners to LOB attributes happens through the universal assignment completion process
3. **Phase Progression**: Phases need to be progressed through the UI or activity management system

### API Path Corrections Made:
- Universal assignments: `/api/v1/universal-assignments/assignments/` (not `/my-assignments`)
- Observations: Uses `cycle_report_observation_mgmt_observation_records` table
- Test executions: Uses `cycle_report_test_execution_results` table

## Recommendations:
1. All functionality exists and works correctly
2. The system uses a service-oriented architecture where tasks are delegated through universal assignments
3. Phase progression should be done through the activity management system
4. No missing functionality was found - only API path and table name differences from initial assumptions
