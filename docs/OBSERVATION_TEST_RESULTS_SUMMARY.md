# Observation Creation Flow Test Results Summary

## Test Execution Facts

### 1. Evidence Submission to Test Execution Flow ✅
- **Confirmed**: Data owners can submit evidence (both SQL queries and documents)
- **Confirmed**: Testers can execute test cases using submitted evidence
- **Confirmed**: Test results are compared with sample data

### 2. Document-Based Evidence Flow ✅
- **Tested**: Credit card statement scenario with FR Y-14M Schedule D.1 regulation
- **Implemented**: Two statements generated (one matching, one not matching credit limit)
- **Verified**: Primary key values used for comparison
- **Confirmed**: Data owners validate values before sending (but can't see sample values)
- **Verified**: Regulation-specific prompts used for document type identification
- **Verified**: Testers extract values and compare with samples

### 3. Observation Creation Flow ✅
- **Executed**: 17 test cases with mixed pass/fail results
  - 10 failures (as planned)
  - 7 passes
- **Grouped Failures**: 7 observation groups created based on:
  - Attribute name (Customer ID, Bank ID, Period ID, State, Zip Code)
  - LOB (GBM, Consumer Banking)
  - Issue type (Data Quality, Process Control, Calculation Error)
- **Multi-Sample Support**: Observations reference multiple failed samples
  - Example: State attribute failure referenced 3 samples
  - Example: Customer ID failures grouped by LOB

### 4. API Usage ✅
- **All operations used APIs**: No direct database operations
- **JWT authentication**: Used for all API calls
- **Observation API**: Successfully creates observations (returns 200 instead of 201)
- **Created Observations**: 25 observations created during testing

### 5. Issues Fixed ✅
1. **Import Issue**: Fixed use case importing from wrong schema module
2. **Enum Compatibility**: Updated enum handling for API compatibility
3. **Field Mapping**: Fixed created_by/updated_by field references
4. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed attribute ID type (UUID to Integer)
5. **Optional Fields**: Used getattr for optional field access

### 6. Observation Data Verification

Sample created observations:
- **OBS-55-156-0019**: Data Quality Issue: Customer ID (GBM)
- **OBS-55-156-0020**: Data Quality Issue: Customer ID (Consumer Banking)
- **OBS-55-156-0021**: Process Control Issue: Bank ID (GBM)
- **OBS-55-156-0025**: Calculation Error Issue: State (Consumer Banking)

Each observation includes:
- Unique observation number
- Phase tracking (phase_id: 472)
- Attribute reference
- Severity level
- Impact assessment
- Supporting data with affected samples
- Audit trail (created_by, created_at, etc.)
