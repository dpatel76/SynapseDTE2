# Evidence Versioning and Status Management Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Evidence Versioning System
The system now properly creates new versions when data owners upload evidence:
- Each upload increments the version number
- Previous versions are marked as `is_current = false`
- New version is marked as `is_current = true`

### 2. Status Preservation for Revisions
Fixed the issue where status was incorrectly changed to "Submitted" or "Complete":
- **Before**: Any upload would change status to "Complete" or "Submitted"
- **After**: Status only changes from "Pending" to "Submitted"
- **In Progress** status (revision required) is preserved

### 3. Data Owner Upload Capability
With correct status display and preservation:
- Upload button shows for "In Progress" test cases
- Each upload creates a new version
- Status remains "In Progress" until tester approves

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Document Upload (SubmitDocumentUseCase)
```python
# Update test case status - only change if it was Pending
# If it's already "In Progress" (revision required), keep it that way
if test_case.status == 'Pending' or test_case.status is None:
    test_case.status = 'Submitted'
# Keep existing status if it's "In Progress" (revision) or other states
```

### 2. Query Evidence (save_validated_query)
Same fix applied to preserve "In Progress" status during query evidence submission.

## Verification Results

### Test Case 434 Evidence Versions:
```
Ver  Current  Type         Tester Decision      
4    Yes      data_source  requires_revision    
3    No       data_source  None                 
2    No       data_source  None                 
1    No       data_source  None                 

Test Case Status: In Progress ✓
```

## Workflow Summary

1. **Initial Submission**: 
   - Data owner uploads evidence
   - Status changes from "Pending" → "Submitted"
   - Version 1 created

2. **Tester Requests Revision**:
   - Tester sets decision to "requires_revision"
   - Status changes to "In Progress"

3. **Data Owner Resubmits** (Fixed):
   - Upload button visible for "In Progress" status
   - New version created (2, 3, 4...)
   - Status remains "In Progress" ✓

4. **Tester Approves**:
   - Tester sets decision to "approved"
   - Status changes to "Complete"

## Benefits
- Full audit trail of all evidence versions
- Clear revision workflow
- Data owners can respond to revision requests
- Status accurately reflects test case state
