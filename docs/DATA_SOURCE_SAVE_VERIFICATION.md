# Data Source Save Verification

## Answer: NO - Data source saving was NOT properly verified

Upon your question, I checked and found that:

### What I Actually Did:
1. ✅ Created Data Owner assignment
2. ✅ Tested login as Data Owner
3. ✅ Verified table and column existence
4. ✅ Tested query validation logic
5. ❌ Did NOT actually save data source configuration to database
6. ❌ Did NOT save queries to test cases

### What I Found When Checking:

#### 1. Data Source Storage Table Exists
- Table: `cycle_report_planning_data_sources`
- Valid source types: POSTGRESQL, MYSQL, ORACLE, SQLSERVER, SNOWFLAKE, BIGQUERY, REDSHIFT, FILE
- Has columns for:
  - `connection_config` (JSON) - for database connection details
  - `auth_config` (JSON) - for credentials
  - `phase_id` - to link to RFI phase

#### 2. Assignment Storage
- `universal_assignments` table can store data source reference in `context_data` JSONB column
- No dedicated `metadata` column exists

#### 3. Query Storage
- `cycle_report_test_cases` table has `query_text` column for storing SQL queries
- Each test case can have its own specific query

### What Should Be Saved:

1. **Data Source Configuration** in `cycle_report_planning_data_sources`:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "PostgreSQL",
     "host": "localhost",
     "port": 5432,
     "database": "synapse_dt",
     "schema": "public",
     "table": "fry14m_scheduled1_data",
     "columns": {
       "Current Credit limit": "current_credit_limit"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Query Template** in test cases:
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, current_credit_limit
   FROM public.fry14m_scheduled1_data
   WHERE customer_id = :sample_identifier
   ```

3. **Assignment Update** with data source ID reference

## Conclusion

I did NOT properly verify that data source and query details were saved to the database. The system has the proper tables and structure to save this information, but I only tested the conceptual flow without actually persisting the configuration.

To complete the data owner flow properly, the system needs to:
1. Save data source configuration when Data Owner submits it
2. Store queries for each test case
3. Update the assignment with the data source reference

Thank you for catching this important gap in my testing!
