# Version Metadata Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented version metadata tracking for all phases (Sample Selection, Scoping, and Data Profiling) to properly track when versions are:
1. Approved by Tester (when submitted for Report Owner review)
2. Reviewed by Report Owner (when RO completes assignment)
3. Marked as final version (when both approvals exist)

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Services Created

#### `app/services/version_metadata_updater.py`
- Updates version metadata when Report Owner completes assignments
- Tracks:
  - `reviewed_by_report_owner`: Boolean flag
  - `report_owner_id`: User ID of reviewer
  - `report_owner_review_date`: Timestamp of review
  - `report_owner_decision`: approved/rejected/revision_required
- Handles final version marking when both approvals exist

#### `app/services/version_tester_approval.py`
- Marks versions as approved by tester when submitted
- Tracks:
  - `approved_by_tester`: Boolean flag
  - `tester_id`: User ID of tester
  - `tester_approval_date`: Timestamp of approval

### 2. Modified Files

#### `app/services/universal_assignment_service.py`
- Added call to `VersionMetadataUpdater` when assignments are completed
- Handles assignment types:
  - `Sample Selection Approval`
  - `Scoping Approval`
  - `Rule Approval` (for Data Profiling)

#### `app/api/v1/endpoints/sample_selection.py`
- Added `phase_id` to assignment context data
- Added call to mark version as approved by tester on submission

#### `app/services/scoping_service.py`
- Added `phase_id` to assignment context data
- Added call to mark version as approved by tester on submission

#### `app/api/v1/endpoints/data_profiling.py`
- Fixed assignment creation to use proper method signature
- Changed assignment type from "Data Profiling Review" to "Rule Approval"
- Added `phase_id` to assignment context data
- Added call to mark version as approved by tester on submission

### 3. Version Metadata Structure

When a version is submitted by Tester:
```json
{
  "approved_by_tester": true,
  "tester_id": 123,
  "tester_approval_date": "2025-01-25T10:30:00"
}
```

When Report Owner completes review:
```json
{
  "approved_by_tester": true,
  "tester_id": 123,
  "tester_approval_date": "2025-01-25T10:30:00",
  "reviewed_by_report_owner": true,
  "report_owner_id": 456,
  "report_owner_review_date": "2025-01-25T14:30:00",
  "report_owner_decision": "approved"
}
```

When both approvals exist (final version):
```json
{
  "approved_by_tester": true,
  "tester_id": 123,
  "tester_approval_date": "2025-01-25T10:30:00",
  "reviewed_by_report_owner": true,
  "report_owner_id": 456,
  "report_owner_review_date": "2025-01-25T14:30:00",
  "report_owner_decision": "approved",
  "is_final_version": true,
  "final_version_date": "2025-01-25T14:30:00"
}
```

### 4. How It Works

1. **Tester Submits Version**
   - Version status changes to `pending_approval`
   - Version metadata updated with `approved_by_tester = true`
   - Universal Assignment created for Report Owner

2. **Report Owner Reviews**
   - When RO completes assignment, `complete_assignment` is called
   - `VersionMetadataUpdater.handle_assignment_completion` is triggered
   - Version metadata updated with RO review information
   - If RO approves and tester already approved, version marked as final

3. **Final Version Marking**
   - Only one version per phase can be marked as final
   - Previous final versions are automatically unmarked
   - Both tester and RO approval required for final status

### 5. Testing

Created `test_version_metadata_updates.py` to verify:
- Version metadata is properly updated
- Tester approvals are tracked
- Report Owner reviews are tracked
- Final versions are correctly marked

### 6. Important Notes

1. **Assignment Types**: Data Profiling uses "Rule Approval" assignment type (not "Data Profiling Review")

2. **Context Data**: All assignments must include:
   - `phase_id`: Required for version metadata updates
   - `version_id`: Links assignment to specific version
   - `cycle_id` and `report_id`: For identification

3. **Metadata Storage**: Version metadata is stored in JSONB `metadata` column on version tables

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing versions without metadata will work correctly - metadata is optional

## Benefits

1. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who approved what and when
2. **Version Control**: Clear identification of which version was reviewed by Report Owner
3. **Final Version**: Unambiguous marking of the approved version for each phase
4. **Report Owner Feedback**: RO feedback tabs now correctly show only the version they reviewed
