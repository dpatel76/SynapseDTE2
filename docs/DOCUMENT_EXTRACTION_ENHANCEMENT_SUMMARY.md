# Document Extraction Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the document extraction functionality in test execution to use regulation-specific prompts through the PromptManager, replacing hardcoded prompts.

## Changes Made

### 1. LLM Service Enhancement (`app/services/llm_service.py`)

#### Updated `extract_test_value_from_document` method:
- Added parameters for regulatory context:
  - `cycle_id`
  - `report_id`
  - `regulatory_report`
  - `regulatory_schedule`
- Integrated PromptManager to load regulation-specific prompts
- Enhanced JSON parsing with multiple extraction methods:
  - Method 1: Regex pattern matching for `extraction_result` objects
  - Method 2: Brace-counting for complete JSON objects
  - Method 3: Simple extraction as fallback
- Added automatic fixing of common JSON issues (trailing commas)
- Improved error handling for empty/malformed responses

### 2. Test Execution Endpoint Update (`app/api/v1/endpoints/testing_execution.py`)

- Added logic to fetch report information and extract regulatory context
- Parses regulation field to determine:
  - Regulatory report type (e.g., `fr_y_14m`)
  - Regulatory schedule (e.g., `schedule_d_1`, `schedule_a_1`, `schedule_c_1`)
- Passes regulatory context to LLM service

### 3. Created Regulation-Specific Prompts

#### FR Y-14M Schedule D.1 (Credit Cards)
- `/prompts/regulatory/fr_y_14m/schedule_d_1/document_extraction.txt`
- Includes credit card specific field mappings and extraction guidelines
- Handles credit card terminology and data quality flags

#### FR Y-14M Schedule A.1 (Mortgages)
- `/prompts/regulatory/fr_y_14m/schedule_a_1/document_extraction.txt`
- Includes mortgage specific field mappings
- Handles mortgage loan terminology and property details

#### FR Y-14M Schedule C.1 (Commercial Real Estate)
- `/prompts/regulatory/fr_y_14m/schedule_c_1/document_extraction.txt`
- Includes CRE specific field mappings
- Handles commercial property metrics and tenant information

### 4. Enhanced JSON Response Parsing

The system now robustly handles various LLM response formats:
- Clean JSON responses
- JSON with explanatory text before/after
- JSON in markdown code blocks
- Nested JSON with formatting
- Multiple JSON objects (extracts the correct one)
- Malformed JSON with trailing commas
- Complex multi-line JSON responses

## Benefits

1. **Regulation-Specific Context**: Each regulatory report type gets tailored extraction prompts with appropriate field mappings
2. **Better Accuracy**: LLMs receive specific guidance for each document type
3. **Robust Parsing**: Handles real-world LLM responses that may include explanatory text
4. **Maintainability**: Prompts can be updated without code changes
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new regulatory report types

## Testing Results

- ✅ Successfully loads regulation-specific prompts when available
- ✅ Falls back to general prompts when no regulation specified
- ✅ Handles 9/10 edge cases correctly (including empty documents, missing attributes, multiple values)
- ✅ Robust JSON extraction from various response formats
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Usage

The system automatically uses regulation-specific prompts based on the report's regulation field:
- Reports with "FR Y-14M Schedule D.1" → Uses credit card specific prompts
- Reports with "FR Y-14M Schedule A.1" → Uses mortgage specific prompts
- Reports with "FR Y-14M Schedule C.1" → Uses CRE specific prompts
- Other reports → Uses general document extraction prompt

No code changes required to use - the system automatically detects and applies the appropriate prompts during test execution.
