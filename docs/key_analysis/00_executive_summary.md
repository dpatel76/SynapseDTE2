# UUID Migration & Key Consolidation - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

The SynapseDTE application requires comprehensive database schema standardization to address:
1. **Inconsistent primary keys**: Mix of integer and UUID types
2. **Redundant keys**: Duplicate keys created unnecessarily (e.g., planning_id â†’ scoping_key)
3. **Technical debt**: Increasing complexity and maintenance burden

## Business Impact

### Benefits
- **Reduced Complexity**: 15% fewer database columns, 30% simpler queries
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized data flow, reduced joins
- **Better Maintainability**: Consistent patterns across the application
- **Future Scalability**: UUID support for distributed systems

### Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: 310 files, 8,400 lines of code impacted
- **Downtime Requirements**: Estimated 2-4 hours for critical phases
- **Performance Changes**: UUID indexes are 4x larger than integers
- **Rollback Complexity**: Multi-phase approach requires careful planning

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach: Direct Migration in 7 Phases
1. **Week 1**: Foundation & Infrastructure
2. **Week 2**: Leaf Tables (Low Risk)
3. **Week 3-4**: User System (Critical)
4. **Week 5-6**: Workflow Core
5. **Week 7-8**: Attribute System & Consolidation
6. **Week 9**: Dependent Systems
7. **Week 10**: Cleanup & Optimization

### Key Consolidation Example
**Current State**: Planning creates `planning_id`, Scoping creates separate `scoping_key`
**Target State**: Use `planning_id` throughout, eliminate redundant keys

## Resource Requirements

### Team
- 2 Backend Engineers (full-time, 10 weeks)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (50%, weeks 3-8)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (25%, throughout)
- 1 QA Engineer (50%, weeks 2-10)

### Infrastructure
- Test environment matching production
- Additional database for mapping tables
- Monitoring and alerting enhancement

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each phase validated in staging
2. **Rollback Capability**: Every step must be reversible
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics during migration
4. **Clear Communication**: Stakeholder updates at each phase

## Decision Points

### Phase 3 (Week 3-4): User System Migration
- **Critical Decision**: Proceed or rollback based on authentication testing
- **Success Criteria**: 100% login success, <10% performance impact

### Phase 5 (Week 7-8): Key Consolidation
- **Critical Decision**: Complete consolidation or maintain dual keys
- **Success Criteria**: All workflows function correctly, data integrity maintained

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backups, mapping tables
2. **Performance**: Benchmark testing, index optimization
3. **Downtime**: Phased approach, low-activity windows
4. **Rollback**: Automated procedures, state tracking

## Recommendations

1. **Approval Required**: Phase-by-phase approval process
2. **Start Small**: Begin with leaf tables to validate approach
3. **Monitor Closely**: Real-time validation during migration
4. **Prepare Rollback**: Test rollback procedures before each phase

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** the detailed implementation plan
2. **Allocate resources** for the 10-week project
3. **Set up test environment** for migration validation
4. **Schedule Phase 1** to begin with foundation setup
