# Scoping Page Read-Only Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This implementation adds proper version control and read-only behavior to the scoping page to prevent unauthorized changes after submission.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Read-Only State Management
- Added `isReadOnly()` helper function that determines when the page should be read-only:
  - When viewing a historical version
  - When a submission exists and no revision is requested
  - When the phase is completed
  - When the user doesn't have the correct role

- Added `canEditDecisions()` helper function that checks if editing is allowed:
  - Returns true if no submission exists yet
  - Returns true if revision is requested

### 2. Version Control System
- Added state for version management:
  - `selectedVersion`: Currently selected version number
  - `viewingVersion`: Full version data when viewing historical submission
  - `versions`: Array of all submission versions

- Added `loadSpecificVersion()` function to load historical versions
- Version selector dropdown displays all submission versions with:
  - Version number and submission date
  - Submitter name
  - Review decision status
  - Visual indicators for current version

### 3. Submission Status Display
- New card component showing:
  - Current version number
  - Submission status
  - Review decision
  - Review comments (if any)
  - Read-only mode warning when applicable

### 4. UI Controls Protection
- **ScopingDecisionToggle**: Disabled when in read-only mode
- **Bulk selection checkboxes**: Disabled when in read-only mode
- **Select all checkbox**: Disabled when in read-only mode
- **Bulk action buttons**: Disabled when in read-only mode
- **Submit button**: Hidden when in read-only mode, shows "Resubmit" when revision requested
- **Auto-save**: Prevented when in read-only mode

### 5. Visual Feedback
- Read-only warning banner with appropriate messaging:
  - Historical version viewing message
  - Revision required message
  - Finalized submission message
- Color-coded status indicators
- Clear visual distinction between editable and read-only states

## Component Changes

### ScopingPage.tsx
1. Added new interfaces:
   - `ScopingVersion`: Structure for version history data

2. Added new state variables:
   - Version management state
   - Read-only determination helpers

3. Modified functions:
   - `handleScopingDecision`: Added read-only checks
   - `saveAllScopingDecisions`: Added read-only prevention
   - `loadVersionHistory`: Enhanced to handle version data

4. Added new UI sections:
   - Submission status card
   - Version selector dropdown
   - Read-only warnings

### ScopingDecisionToggle.tsx
- Already properly handles disabled state passed from parent

## Usage Flow

### Normal Submission Flow
1. Tester makes scoping decisions
2. Submits for approval
3. Page becomes read-only
4. Version 1 is created

### Revision Flow
1. Report Owner requests revision
2. Page becomes editable again for Tester
3. Tester makes changes
4. Resubmits (creates version 2)
5. Page becomes read-only again

### Version History Viewing
1. User selects a historical version from dropdown
2. Page loads that version's decisions
3. All controls are disabled
4. Warning shows viewing historical data

## Testing

Created `test_scoping_readonly.py` to verify:
- Submission creation
- Read-only state after submission
- Revision request handling
- Version history retrieval
- Proper state transitions

## Backend Requirements

The implementation assumes these endpoints exist:
- `GET /scoping/cycles/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/versions`
- `GET /scoping/cycles/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/versions/{version}`
- `GET /scoping/cycles/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/feedback`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Version Comparison**: Add ability to compare two versions side-by-side
2. **Change Tracking**: Highlight what changed between versions
3. **Audit Trail**: Show who made what changes when
4. **Rollback**: Allow reverting to a previous version
5. **Comments**: Add version-specific comments/notes

## Security Considerations

- All permission checks are enforced on the backend
- Frontend read-only state is for UX only
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized modifications
- Audit trail tracks all changes for compliance
