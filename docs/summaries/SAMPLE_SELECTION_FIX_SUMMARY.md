# Sample Selection Page Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
When selecting the sampling phase for a cycle report, users were seeing no content (blank page).

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Missing Routes ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `WorkflowProgress` component was trying to navigate to:
```
/cycles/${cycleId}/reports/${reportId}/sample-selection
```

But `App.tsx` only had a route for:
```
/phases/sample-selection
```

**Solution**: Added missing cycle-specific routes in `App.tsx`:
```typescript
<Route path="/cycles/:cycleId/reports/:reportId/sample-selection" element={<LazySampleSelectionPage />} />
<Route path="/cycles/:cycleId/reports/:reportId/data-provider" element={<LazyDataProviderPage />} />
<Route path="/cycles/:cycleId/reports/:reportId/request-info" element={<LazyRequestInfoPage />} />
<Route path="/cycles/:cycleId/reports/:reportId/testing-execution" element={<LazyTestingExecutionPage />} />
<Route path="/cycles/:cycleId/reports/:reportId/observation-management" element={<LazyObservationManagementPage />} />
```

### 2. Non-existent Redirect Routes ❌ → ✅ TEMPORARILY DISABLED
**Problem**: Report Owners were being redirected to non-existent routes:
- `/cycles/${cycleId}/reports/${reportId}/sample-selection-review` 
- `/cycles/${cycleId}/reports/${reportId}/data-provider-review`

**Solution**: Temporarily disabled role-based redirections and added TODO comments to create proper review pages later.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Routing (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- ✅ Added cycle-specific routes for all workflow phases
- ✅ Kept legacy `/phases/*` routes for backwards compatibility

### Sample Selection Page (`frontend/src/pages/phases/SampleSelectionPage.tsx`)
- ✅ Temporarily disabled Report Owner redirection
- ✅ Added debug logging to track component loading
- ✅ Component now loads for all user roles

### Data Provider Page (`frontend/src/pages/phases/DataProviderPage.tsx`)
- ✅ Applied same fixes as Sample Selection page
- ✅ Consistent behavior across both reconstructed pages

## Current Status
- ✅ **Sample Selection page should now load properly**
- ✅ **Data Provider page should now load properly**
- ✅ **All user roles can access the pages**
- ✅ **Debug logging available in browser console**

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to a cycle report**
2. **Click on "Sampling" phase in workflow progress**
3. **Verify the page loads with content**
4. **Check browser console for debug logs:**
   ```
   SampleSelectionPage loaded with: {cycleId: "123", reportId: "456", ...}
   ```

## Next Steps (Future Work)

### Create Review Pages for Report Owners
- [ ] Create `SampleSelectionReviewPage.tsx`
- [ ] Create `DataProviderReviewPage.tsx`  
- [ ] Add routes for these review pages
- [ ] Re-enable role-based redirection

### Additional Improvements
- [ ] Add error boundary for better error handling
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add user role indicators in the UI

## Verification
The fix addresses the core routing issue that was preventing the Sample Selection page from loading. Users should now see the full Sample Selection interface with:

- Phase progress stepper
- Action buttons (Start, Generate, Upload, etc.)
- Sample sets table
- Proper dialog interactions
