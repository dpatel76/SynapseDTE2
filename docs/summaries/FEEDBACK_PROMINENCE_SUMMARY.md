# Enhanced Report Owner Feedback Prominence for Testers

## Overview
Implemented more prominent display of Report Owner feedback on the tester screen when there is unaddressed feedback, ensuring testers cannot miss important revision requests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Prominent Alert Banner at Top of Page
Added a large warning alert that appears at the top of the Sample Selection page when:
- User is a Tester
- There are sample sets with "Revision Required" status
- Those sample sets have associated feedback

The alert features:
- **Warning icon and color** to grab attention
- **Clear title**: "Report Owner Feedback Requires Action"
- **Summary** of how many sample sets need attention
- **List of sample sets** with their names and feedback preview
- **"View Feedback" button** for quick access

### 2. Enhanced Sample Set Table Display
- Sample sets with "Revision Required" status now show:
  - A **"Has Feedback" badge** next to the status chip
  - **Pulsing animation** on the feedback icon button to draw attention
  - **Warning color** (orange) for the feedback icon instead of info color (blue)

### 3. Improved Feedback Dialog Styling
- **Colored title bar** (warning color for revision required)
- **Warning icon** in the dialog title
- **Enhanced alert styling** with AlertTitle for better hierarchy
- **Highlighted feedback box** with warning color border when revision is required
- **Bold text** for feedback that requires action

### 4. Visual Indicators Throughout
- Added "Revision Required" to the status color mapping (shows as warning/orange)
- Feedback indicators pulse with animation when action is needed
- Multiple visual cues ensure feedback cannot be missed

## User Experience Flow

1. **Tester logs in** → Immediately sees warning alert if feedback exists
2. **Alert shows** → Lists all sample sets needing attention with feedback preview
3. **Click "View Feedback"** → Opens detailed feedback dialog
4. **Table view** → Shows badges and pulsing icons for sets with feedback
5. **Clear next steps** → Dialog includes "Resubmit with Changes" button

## Benefits

1. **Impossible to Miss** - Multiple prominent indicators ensure feedback is seen
2. **Quick Overview** - Alert summarizes all feedback at a glance
3. **Easy Navigation** - Direct links to view detailed feedback
4. **Clear Actions** - Obvious next steps for addressing feedback
5. **Visual Hierarchy** - Most important information stands out

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Material-UI AlertTitle component for better alert structure
- CSS animations for pulsing effect on feedback icons
- Conditional rendering based on sample set status and feedback presence
- Warning color scheme consistently applied across all feedback UI elements
- Responsive design maintains prominence on all screen sizes

## Screenshots of Key Features

1. **Top Alert Banner**: Large warning alert listing all sets with feedback
2. **Table Badges**: "Has Feedback" badges and pulsing icons
3. **Enhanced Dialog**: Warning-colored title and highlighted feedback
4. **Status Indicators**: Consistent warning colors for revision required

This implementation ensures that testers will always be aware of pending Report Owner feedback and can quickly take action to address it.
