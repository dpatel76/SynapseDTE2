# Tester Dashboard Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The tester dashboard and other pages are showing no content because the tester user has no reports assigned. The application is working correctly - it's just displaying empty states.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Verify Backend is Working
The backend APIs are functioning correctly:
- Login endpoint: ✓ Working
- Tester stats endpoint: ✓ Working (returns 0 assigned reports)
- Reports by tester endpoint: ✓ Working (returns empty array)

### 2. To See Content as a Tester

You need to have reports assigned to the tester. This can be done by:

1. **Login as Test Executive** (testmgr@synapse.com / TestUser123!)
2. **Create a Test Cycle**
   - Go to Test Cycles page
   - Click "Create Test Cycle"
   - Fill in the details
3. **Assign Reports to the Cycle**
   - In the cycle detail page, add reports
   - Assign tester@synapse.com as the tester for those reports
4. **Login as Tester** to see the assigned reports

### 3. Test User Credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Tester | tester@synapse.com | TestUser123! |
| Test Executive | testmgr@synapse.com | TestUser123! |
| Report Owner | owner@synapse.com | TestUser123! |
| Data Provider | provider@synapse.com | TestUser123! |
| Data Executive | cdo@synapse.com | TestUser123! |

### 4. Frontend Compilation Issue (Fixed)
The `UsersPage.tsx` compilation error has been fixed by removing the duplicate MenuItem import.

### 5. What Pages Should Show for Tester

When logged in as a tester with assigned reports, you should see:
- **Tester Dashboard** - Overview of assigned reports with stats
- **Test Cycles** - List of cycles where you have assigned reports
- **Planning Phase** - Upload documents and generate attributes
- **Scoping Phase** - Review and submit scoping decisions
- **Sample Selection** - Select test samples
- **Test Execution** - Execute tests on samples
- **Observation Management** - Create and manage observations

## Current Status
✅ Backend APIs are working correctly
✅ Frontend compilation issues fixed
✅ Authentication and authorization working
⚠️ No reports assigned to tester (this is why pages appear empty)

## Next Steps
1. Create test data by logging in as Test Executive
2. Create a test cycle and assign reports to the tester
3. Then login as tester to see the full functionality
