# LLM Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Common Prompts Directory for FR Y-14M
- Created `/prompts/regulatory/fr_y_14m/common/` directory
- Added all required prompt files:
  - `attribute_discovery.txt`
  - `attribute_batch_details.txt`
  - `scoping_recommendations.txt`
  - `testing_approach.txt`

### 2. Missing Regulatory Directories
Created complete directory structures and prompt files for:

#### FR Y-14Q
- Created `/prompts/regulatory/fr_y_14q/` structure with:
  - `common/` - General FR Y-14Q prompts
  - `schedule_a/` - Capital Assessments and Stress Testing
  - `schedule_b/` - Loan Portfolio Information
  - `schedule_c/` - Trading and Counterparty Risk

#### CCAR
- Created `/prompts/regulatory/ccar/` structure with:
  - `common/` - General CCAR prompts
  - `schedule_1a/` - Income Statement Projections
  - `schedule_1b/` - Balance Sheet Projections
  - `schedule_2a/` - Loss Projections

#### Basel III
- Created `/prompts/regulatory/basel_iii/` structure with:
  - `basel_common/` - Basel III framework prompts

#### FR Y-9C
- Created `/prompts/regulatory/fr_y_9c/` structure with:
  - `common/` - Consolidated Financial Statements prompts

### 3. Prompt Content
All prompt files were created with:
- Regulation-specific expert context
- Appropriate field categories for each regulation/schedule
- Consistent format across all prompts
- Template variables for dynamic content (${report_name}, ${regulatory_context}, ${attributes})

## Verification Results
After fixes, all verification checks pass:
- ✅ Regulation Mappings: All directories and files exist
- ✅ Batch Configurations: All within expected bounds
- ✅ Prompt Loading: All prompts load successfully
- ✅ Special Handling: Rules properly configured
- ✅ Dynamic Batch Sizing: Working correctly
