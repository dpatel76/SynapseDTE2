# Sample Selection Versioning Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented versioning functionality for sample selection submissions to handle Report Owner feedback and revision cycles, along with approval button state management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Enhancements

#### a) Updated Sample Submission Endpoint (`/sample-selection/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/sample-sets/{set_id}/submit`)
- Added logic to detect resubmission after revision (when status is 'Revision Required')
- Integrated with `SampleSetVersioningService` to create new versions when resubmitting
- New versions maintain the relationship to the master set and increment version numbers
- Preserves feedback history from previous approval attempts

#### b) Added Approval Status Check Endpoint (`/sample-selection/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/sample-sets/{set_id}/approval-status`)
- Returns whether a sample set has already been decisioned
- Provides `has_decision` and `can_approve` flags for frontend UI state management
- Includes latest decision details if available
- Prevents duplicate approvals on the same version

#### c) Enhanced Pending Reviews Endpoint
- Now includes version_number in the response
- Only shows latest versions (is_latest_version = True)
- Provides submission type information (all samples vs selected samples)

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### a) Created SampleReviewPage Component (`/frontend/src/pages/phases/SampleReviewPage.tsx`)
- Comprehensive sample review interface for Report Owners
- Displays sample set details, generation rationale, and sample preview
- Shows version history with navigation between versions
- Approval/Reject/Request Changes workflow with feedback
- Approval buttons automatically disabled after decision is made
- Individual sample approval capability (for granular control)

#### b) Updated Report Owner Dashboard
- Modified sample review table to link to the new SampleReviewPage
- Navigation updated to include set_id: `/cycles/{cycleId}/reports/{reportId}/sample-review/{setId}`

#### c) Added Route Configuration
- Added route in App.tsx: `/cycles/:cycleId/reports/:reportId/sample-review/:setId`
- Lazy loaded component with proper error boundaries

### 3. Key Features Implemented

1. **Version Creation on Resubmission**
   - When a tester resubmits after receiving "Revision Required" feedback, a new version is automatically created
   - The new version starts fresh but maintains the relationship to previous versions
   - Feedback from the previous version is preserved in the version notes

2. **Approval State Management**
   - Once a Report Owner makes a decision (approve/reject/request changes), the approval buttons are disabled
   - The UI clearly indicates that a decision has been made
   - Testers must create a new version (by resubmitting) to get another review

3. **Version History Tracking**
   - Complete audit trail of all versions
   - Each version shows its status, sample count, and notes
   - Report Owners can navigate between versions to see the progression

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Report Owner feedback is stored and visible to testers
   - Requested changes are tracked
   - Testers can see what improvements are needed before resubmission

## Usage Flow

1. **Tester submits sample set** → Status: "Pending Approval"
2. **Report Owner reviews** → Can approve, reject, or request changes
3. **If changes requested** → Status: "Revision Required"
4. **Tester makes improvements and resubmits** → Creates new version with status: "Pending Approval"
5. **Report Owner reviews new version** → Previous version's approval buttons are disabled
6. **Process continues until approved or rejected**

## API Endpoints

```bash
# Check if sample set has been decisioned
GET /api/v1/sample-selection/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/sample-sets/{set_id}/approval-status

# Submit sample set (handles versioning automatically)
POST /api/v1/sample-selection/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/sample-sets/{set_id}/submit

# Get pending reviews (includes version info)
GET /api/v1/sample-selection/pending-reviews

# Get version history
GET /api/v1/sample-selection/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/sample-sets/{set_id}/versions
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Audit Trail** - All versions and decisions are tracked
2. **No Duplicate Approvals** - Once decided, buttons are disabled
3. **Improved Communication** - Feedback is preserved across versions
4. **Better UX** - Clear indication of approval state and next steps
5. **Compliance** - Complete history of all approval decisions

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Creating a sample set as a Tester
2. Submitting it for approval
3. As Report Owner, requesting changes
4. As Tester, resubmitting (creates new version)
5. Verifying that the old version cannot be re-approved
6. Checking version history shows both versions
