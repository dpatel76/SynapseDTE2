# Sample Selection Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes

1. **Make Changes Endpoint** (`app/api/v1/endpoints/sample_selection.py`):
   - Changed logic to find the version that was actually submitted (has submission record)
   - Instead of using earliest version with feedback (v1), it now finds the submitted version (v2)
   - This ensures all 6 samples are copied, not just 1

2. **Versions API Endpoint**:
   - Added `was_submitted` and `has_report_owner_feedback` fields to version info
   - This allows frontend to easily identify which version was reviewed

### Frontend Changes

1. **Report Owner Feedback Component** (`frontend/src/components/sample-selection/ReportOwnerFeedback.tsx`):
   - Simplified logic to use version API to find submitted version with feedback
   - Removed complex timestamp-based logic that was selecting wrong version
   - Now correctly shows Version 2 with 6 samples instead of Version 1 with 1 sample

## Current Status

### Working:
- Report Owner reviewed Version 2 (6 samples with decisions and LOB assignments)
- Backend Make Changes logic now correctly identifies Version 2 as the feedback source
- Frontend Report Owner Feedback tab will show Version 2 when backend is running

### Issues Found:
- Version 6 has 12 samples (duplicates) - architectural issue
- LOB assignments are properly preserved in Make Changes (confirmed in code)
- All 6 samples from Version 2 should be copied with their decisions and LOBs

## To Test

1. Start backend: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/cycles/55/reports/156/sample-selection
3. Report Owner Feedback tab should show:
   - Version 2 
   - 6 samples with decisions and LOB assignments
4. Click Make Changes should create new version with:
   - All 6 samples from Version 2
   - Preserved Report Owner decisions
   - Preserved LOB assignments
   - Reset tester decisions for rejected samples

## Architecture Issues to Address

1. **Duplicate Samples**: Version 6 has 12 samples instead of 6 - need to prevent creating duplicates
2. **Version Metadata**: Consider using database metadata fields instead of analyzing sample data
3. **Submission Tracking**: Need better tracking of which version was submitted for review
