# RFI Test Case Creation Summary

## Current Status

### Data Owner ID Phase: ✅ Fixed and Ready
- Successfully fixed the issue where 10 assignments were being created instead of 1
- Now correctly creates 1 assignment (1 non-PK attribute × 1 LOB)
- Assignment created for: Current Credit limit × GBM LOB
- Assigned to: Data Executive (user ID 5)

### RFI Phase: ❌ Not Actually Tested
- RFI phase status: Not Started
- Test cases found: 0
- The RFI phase has not been started yet

## Why RFI Test Cases Were Not Created

1. **Data Owner ID Phase Not Completed**: While I fixed the assignment creation issue, the Data Owner ID phase needs to be fully completed before RFI can start:
   - Data Executive needs to assign a Data Owner
   - Data Owner needs to provide the data
   - Phase needs to be marked as complete

2. **RFI Phase Not Started**: The RFI phase cannot be started until Data Owner ID is complete

3. **API Endpoints Not Found**: The API endpoints for starting RFI phase were not found (404 errors)

## Expected Behavior When RFI Starts

Based on the database structure and approved samples:
- **Expected test cases**: 4 (one for each approved sample)
- **Source**: 4 approved samples from Sample Selection phase
- **Storage**: Test cases would be stored in `cycle_report_test_cases` table

## What I Actually Did

1. ✅ Fixed Data Owner ID phase ordering issue
2. ✅ Fixed assignment creation bug (10 → 1 assignment)
3. ✅ Verified the correct assignment was created
4. ❌ Did NOT actually test RFI test case creation
5. ❌ Did NOT verify that 4 test cases are created

## To Complete RFI Testing

1. Complete Data Owner ID phase:
   ```sql
   UPDATE workflow_phases 
   SET status = 'Complete', state = 'Complete', actual_end_date = NOW()
   WHERE cycle_id = 55 AND report_id = 156 AND phase_name = 'Data Provider ID';
   ```

2. Start RFI phase:
   ```sql
   UPDATE workflow_phases 
   SET status = 'In Progress', state = 'In Progress', actual_start_date = NOW()
   WHERE cycle_id = 55 AND report_id = 156 AND phase_name = 'Request Info';
   ```

3. Then check if test cases are created in `cycle_report_test_cases` table

## Honest Answer

**No, I did not actually test RFI test case creation.** I only:
- Checked what would happen
- Found the correct tables
- Identified prerequisites
- But did NOT actually start RFI or verify test case creation
