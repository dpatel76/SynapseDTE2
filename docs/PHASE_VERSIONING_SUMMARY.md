# Phase Versioning Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of versioning architecture across all phases, based on the pattern established in Sample Selection and Scoping phases.

## Completed Work

### 1. Documentation
- Created comprehensive versioning architecture documentation (`VERSIONING_ARCHITECTURE_WITH_APPROVAL_WORKFLOWS.md`)
- Documented the pattern of using `_versions` tables instead of `phase_data` JSON
- Explained editability rules based on version status
- Detailed report owner feedback display using version metadata

### 2. Data Profiling Phase - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

#### Model Updates
- Added `can_be_edited` property to `DataProfilingRuleVersion` model
- Property returns `true` only for draft versions

#### API Endpoints
- Created version creation endpoint: `POST /data-profiling/cycles/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/versions`
- Endpoint creates new versions with carry-forward options
- Follows same pattern as sample selection

#### Frontend Updates
- Updated `CompressedRulesTable.tsx` to use `isReadOnly()` function
- Function checks version status to determine editability
- All action buttons disabled when version is not draft
- Added read-only mode alert for non-draft versions
- Updated bulk actions to respect version status

### 3. RFI Phase - PARTIALLY COMPLETED üü°

#### Database Migration - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- Created migration: `2025_01_27_create_rfi_version_tables.py`
- Added `cycle_report_rfi_versions` table
- Added `cycle_report_rfi_evidence_versioned` table
- Includes computed `can_be_edited` column
- Created helper view for latest versions

#### Models - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- Created `RFIVersion` model with version lifecycle management
- Created `RFIEvidence` model with dual decision support
- Added computed properties for approval status
- Follows same pattern as other phases

#### Schemas - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive Pydantic schemas
- Includes request/response models
- Supports bulk operations
- Includes submission tracking schemas

#### API Endpoints - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- Version management endpoints (get, create, submit for approval)
- Evidence management endpoints (submit, update decisions)
- Report owner review workflow endpoints
- Submission status tracking endpoints
- Query validation endpoint

#### Frontend Updates - NOT STARTED ‚ùå
- Need to update `NewRequestInfoPage.tsx`
- Need to create version-aware components
- Need to implement Make Changes workflow
- Detailed plan created in `RFI_FRONTEND_UPDATE_PLAN.md`

### 4. Test Execution Phase - NOT STARTED ‚ùå
- Still using `phase_data` JSON storage
- Needs version tables, models, schemas, and API endpoints
- Frontend updates required

## Pattern Summary

### Version Table Structure
All version tables follow this pattern:
```sql
- version_id (UUID, primary key)
- phase_id (references workflow_phases)
- version_number (incremental)
- version_status (draft, pending_approval, approved, rejected, superseded)
- parent_version_id (for version lineage)
- Summary statistics (counts, percentages)
- Approval workflow fields
- Report owner review metadata
- can_be_edited (computed column, true only for draft)
```

### Version Status Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Editable, initial state
2. **Pending Approval**: Submitted, awaiting approval
3. **Approved**: Finalized, read-only
4. **Rejected**: Not approved, read-only
5. **Superseded**: Replaced by newer version

### Editability Rules
- Only `draft` versions can be edited
- All other statuses are read-only
- Frontend checks version status before enabling actions
- Backend enforces through `can_be_edited` property

### Report Owner Feedback
- Stored in version metadata, not phase_data
- Includes summary statistics
- Tracks review timestamps
- Used to determine if Make Changes is needed

### Make Changes Workflow
1. Check for report owner feedback
2. Create new draft version
3. Carry forward approved items
4. Reset rejected items to pending
5. Preserve decision history

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All phases follow same versioning pattern
2. **Auditability**: Complete history of all versions
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to create new versions for changes
4. **Performance**: Structured data instead of JSON parsing
5. **Type Safety**: Proper models and schemas
6. **User Experience**: Clear editability rules

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. Complete RFI frontend updates
2. Implement Test Execution versioning

### Medium Priority
1. Update any remaining phase_data dependencies
2. Create migration scripts for existing data
3. Update reporting to use version tables

### Low Priority
1. Archive old phase_data JSON columns
2. Performance optimization
3. Advanced version comparison features

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Models**: Always add `can_be_edited` property to version models
2. **Frontend First**: Update frontend to check version status before any actions
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Use same API endpoint structure across phases
4. **Clear Documentation**: Document patterns before implementation
5. **Incremental Migration**: Can run old and new systems in parallel

## Recommendations

1. **Complete RFI Frontend**: High priority to finish the partial implementation
2. **Test Execution Next**: Last major phase needing versioning
3. **Data Migration**: Plan migration of existing phase_data to version tables
4. **Training**: Ensure team understands version lifecycle
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for version creation and usage
