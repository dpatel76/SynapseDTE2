# Scoping Phase Versioning Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Scoping phase has been **fully migrated** to the versioning architecture and follows the same patterns as Sample Selection. This analysis confirms that Scoping properly implements version tables, editability rules, and report owner feedback display.

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

### 1. Version Table Architecture

**Tables in Use:**
- `cycle_report_scoping_versions` - Main version tracking table
- `cycle_report_scoping_attributes` - Individual attribute decisions

**Key Observations:**
- ✅ Uses dedicated version tables (NOT phase_data)
- ✅ Implements full version lifecycle (draft → pending_approval → approved/rejected)
- ✅ Tracks dual decisions (tester + report owner)
- ✅ Maintains complete audit trail

### 2. Version Status Management

```python
# From app/models/scoping.py
class VersionStatus(str, Enum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    PENDING_APPROVAL = "pending_approval"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    REJECTED = "rejected"
    SUPERSEDED = "superseded"
```

**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Same status states as Sample Selection
- ✅ Proper status transitions enforced
- ✅ Version immutability after approval

### 3. Editability Rules

```python
# From ScopingVersion model
@hybrid_property
def can_be_edited(self) -> bool:
    """Check if this version can be edited"""
    return self.version_status in [VersionStatus.DRAFT, VersionStatus.REJECTED]
```

**Compliance Check:**
- ✅ Follows same editability logic as Sample Selection
- ✅ Only DRAFT and REJECTED versions are editable
- ✅ Frontend enforces these rules

### 4. Report Owner Feedback Implementation

**At Version Level:**
- `approval_notes` - Feedback when approved
- `rejection_reason` - Feedback when rejected
- `requested_changes` - Specific changes requested (JSONB)

**At Attribute Level:**
```python
# ScopingAttribute model fields
report_owner_decision = Column(report_owner_decision_enum, nullable=True)
report_owner_notes = Column(Text, nullable=True)
report_owner_decided_by_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.user_id'), nullable=True)
report_owner_decided_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)
```

**Display Logic:**
- ✅ Shows feedback only for non-draft versions
- ✅ Displays both version-level and attribute-level feedback
- ✅ Tracks decision maker and timestamp

### 5. Service Layer Implementation

From `app/services/scoping_service.py`:
- ✅ Proper version creation with incrementing numbers
- ✅ Status transition validation
- ✅ Role-based permission checks
- ✅ Carries forward data from parent versions

### 6. API Endpoint Patterns

From `app/api/v1/endpoints/scoping.py`:
- ✅ RESTful version management endpoints
- ✅ Separate endpoints for tester and report owner decisions
- ✅ Bulk operations support
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

## Comparison with Sample Selection

| Feature | Sample Selection | Scoping | Match |
|---------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| Version Tables | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Status Enum | 5 states | 5 states | ✅ |
| Editability Rules | Draft/Rejected | Draft/Rejected | ✅ |
| Dual Decisions | Tester + RO | Tester + RO | ✅ |
| Report Owner Feedback | Version + Item | Version + Item | ✅ |
| Audit Trail | Full | Full | ✅ |
| Temporal Integration | Yes | Yes | ✅ |

## Key Strengths

1. **Consistent Architecture**: Follows the exact same pattern as Sample Selection
2. **No phase_data Usage**: Completely migrated to version tables
3. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Every decision and change is audited
4. **Clear Separation**: Version metadata vs. attribute decisions

## Minor Differences (By Design)

1. **Decision Types**: 
   - Sample Selection: approved/rejected/pending
   - Scoping: accept/decline/override (for tester)

2. **Additional Metadata**:
   - Scoping tracks `recommendation_accuracy`
   - Scoping has `resource_impact_assessment`
   - These are phase-specific business requirements

## Frontend Integration

The frontend properly handles:
- Version selection and display
- Editability based on status and role
- Report owner feedback display
- Status-appropriate UI components

## Conclusion

The Scoping phase is **fully compliant** with the versioning architecture and requires no modifications. It serves as an excellent example of how the pattern should be implemented.
