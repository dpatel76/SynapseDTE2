# Notification and Task Management Analysis - SynapseDTE

## Executive Summary

The SynapseDTE system currently implements multiple parallel notification and task management systems without centralization. This analysis identifies 5 different notification mechanisms and 5 task-like entities that operate independently, leading to fragmentation and potential gaps in user awareness.

## Current Implementation Overview

### 1. Notification Systems

#### a) Frontend In-App Notifications (`NotificationContext.tsx`)
- **Status**: Mock implementation with hardcoded data
- **Features**:
  - Toast notifications (temporary)
  - Bell icon notifications (persistent)
  - Priority levels: low, medium, high, critical
  - Categories: system, workflow, user, data, security
  - Related entity tracking
- **Issues**: No backend integration, all notifications are simulated

#### b) CDO Notifications (`cdo_notifications` table)
- **Purpose**: Track CDO assignment notifications
- **Features**:
  - Assignment deadlines
  - SLA hour tracking
  - Response timestamps
- **Issues**: No actual notification delivery mechanism

#### c) Data Provider Notifications (`data_provider_notifications` table)
- **Purpose**: Track data provider information requests
- **Features**:
  - Portal access URL generation
  - First access tracking
  - Acknowledgment status
- **Issues**: Separate from other notification systems

#### d) SLA Escalation Emails (`escalation_email_logs` table)
- **Purpose**: Email notifications for SLA violations
- **Features**:
  - 4 escalation levels
  - Email template system
  - Recipient tracking
- **Issues**: Email-only, no in-app visibility

#### e) Email Service (`app/services/email_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: SMTP-based email delivery
- **Features**:
  - Jinja2 template rendering
  - Async email sending
  - Error handling
- **Issues**: Not integrated with in-app notifications

### 2. Task Management Variations

#### Current Task-Like Entities:

| Entity | Table | Assignment Type | Status Tracking | SLA Integration |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| CDO Assignments | `cdo_notifications` | LOB-based | Yes | Yes |
| Data Provider Assignments | `data_provider_assignments` | Direct user | Yes | Separate |
| Workflow Phases | `workflow_phases` | Role-based | Yes | No |
| Test Cases | `test_cases` | Data provider | Yes | Yes |
| Observations | `observations` | Direct user | Yes | No |

### 3. Assignment Mechanisms

#### a) LOB-Based Assignments
```python
# Current pattern
CDO → assigned to LOB → manages LOB attributes
```

#### b) Direct User Assignments
```python
# Current pattern
Attribute → assigned to → specific data provider
Observation → assigned to → specific user
```

#### c) Role-Based Assignments
```python
# Current pattern
Workflow phase → accessible by → specific roles
```

## Issues and Gaps

### 1. Fragmentation Issues

#### Notification Fragmentation
- **5 separate notification systems** with no centralization
- **No unified notification center** for users
- **Inconsistent delivery mechanisms** (email vs in-app)
- **No notification preferences** management
- **No notification history** tracking

#### Task Management Fragmentation
- **No unified task view** across different entity types
- **Separate dashboards** for each task type
- **No personal TODO list** aggregating all tasks
- **Inconsistent status tracking** across entities

### 2. Missing Critical Features

#### Notification Features
- Real-time notification updates
- Push notifications for mobile
- Notification templates for consistency
- Batch notification operations
- Rich notification content (attachments, actions)

#### Task Management Features
- Task prioritization across types
- Task dependencies
- Bulk task operations
- Task delegation workflow
- Task completion analytics

### 3. Integration Gaps

#### SLA Integration
- SLA violations not triggering in-app notifications
- No proactive SLA warning system
- Escalations only via email
- No SLA dashboard integration

#### Cross-System Integration
- Email notifications not reflected in-app
- Task completions not triggering notifications
- No workflow state change notifications
- Assignment changes not notified

## Recommended Solution Architecture

### 1. Unified Notification System

```python
# Proposed notification model
class Notification(Base):
    __tablename__ = "notifications"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.user_id"))
    type = Column(Enum(NotificationType))  # email, in_app, sms
    category = Column(Enum(NotificationCategory))
    priority = Column(Enum(Priority))
    subject = Column(String)
    body = Column(Text)
    template_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("notification_templates.id"))
    delivery_status = Column(Enum(DeliveryStatus))
    read_at = Column(DateTime)
    action_url = Column(String)
    related_entity_type = Column(String)
    related_entity_id = Column(Integer)
    scheduled_for = Column(DateTime)
    sent_at = Column(DateTime)
```

### 2. Centralized Task Management

```python
# Proposed unified task model
class Task(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tasks"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    type = Column(Enum(TaskType))  # assignment, test_case, observation, phase
    title = Column(String)
    description = Column(Text)
    assigned_to_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.user_id"))
    assigned_by_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.user_id"))
    due_date = Column(DateTime)
    priority = Column(Enum(Priority))
    status = Column(Enum(TaskStatus))
    parent_task_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("tasks.id"))
    
    # Polymorphic association to specific task types
    entity_type = Column(String)
    entity_id = Column(Integer)
```

### 3. Assignment Service Architecture

```python
class AssignmentService:
    async def create_assignment(
        self,
        task_type: TaskType,
        assigned_to: int,
        assigned_by: int,
        due_date: datetime,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Task:
        # Create task
        # Send notification
        # Track in audit log
        # Update SLA tracking
        
    async def reassign_task(
        self,
        task_id: int,
        new_assignee: int,
        reason: str
    ) -> Task:
        # Update assignment
        # Notify both users
        # Track reassignment history
        
    async def suggest_assignee(
        self,
        task_type: TaskType,
        workload_balanced: bool = True
    ) -> List[User]:
        # AI-powered assignment suggestions
        # Based on expertise, workload, history
```

### 4. Notification Service Architecture

```python
class NotificationService:
    async def send_notification(
        self,
        user_id: int,
        notification_type: NotificationType,
        template_id: int,
        context: dict,
        channels: List[Channel] = None
    ) -> Notification:
        # Create notification record
        # Render template with context
        # Send via requested channels
        # Track delivery status
        
    async def send_bulk_notifications(
        self,
        user_ids: List[int],
        template_id: int,
        context: dict
    ) -> List[Notification]:
        # Batch notification creation
        # Optimized delivery
        
    async def mark_as_read(
        self,
        notification_ids: List[int],
        user_id: int
    ) -> None:
        # Update read status
        # Update UI in real-time
```
