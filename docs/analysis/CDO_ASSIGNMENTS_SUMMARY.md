# CDO Assignments Functionality - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented functionality for CDOs to view the data provider assignments they have made for specific attributes in testing cycles.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/data-provider/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/my-assignments`
- **Purpose**: Returns all data provider assignments made by the current CDO
- **Authentication**: Requires CDO role
- **Response**: List of assignments with attribute details, data provider info, and assignment metadata

### 2. Frontend CDO Assignments Page
- **Route**: `/cycles/{cycleId}/reports/{reportId}/cdo-assignments`
- **Component**: `CDOAssignmentsPage.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays assignments in a clean table format
  - Shows attribute names, descriptions, and data provider details
  - Includes assignment status and timestamps
  - Responsive design with loading states and error handling

### 3. Navigation Integration
- Added "My Assignments" button to the Data Provider page
- Button only visible to users with CDO role
- Navigates directly to the CDO assignments page for the current cycle/report

## How to Test

### 1. Login as CDO
- **Email**: `cdo@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **LOB**: GBM (LOB ID: 338)

### 2. Navigate to Data Provider Page
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/cycles/4/reports/156/data-provider`
- You should see a "My Assignments" button in the action buttons section

### 3. View CDO Assignments
- Click the "My Assignments" button
- You should see a page showing assignments made by this CDO
- For cycle 4, report 156, you should see 1 assignment:
  - **Attribute**: Current Credit limit
  - **Data Provider**: Lisa Chen
  - **LOB**: GBM
  - **Status**: Assigned

## Technical Details

### Backend Implementation
```python
@router.get("/{cycle_id}/reports/{report_id}/my-assignments", response_model=List[Dict[str, Any]])
@require_permission("data_provider", "read")
async def get_cdo_assignments(
    cycle_id: int,
    report_id: int,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: Any = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Get data provider assignments made by the current CDO"""
```

### Frontend Integration
- Added lazy-loaded route in `App.tsx`
- Added conditional button in `DataProviderPage.tsx`
- Created comprehensive `CDOAssignmentsPage.tsx` component

### Security
- Endpoint requires CDO role verification
- Only shows assignments made by the authenticated CDO
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## Test Results
✅ **Authentication**: CDO login works with correct credentials  
✅ **Backend API**: Returns correct assignments for CDO  
✅ **Frontend Integration**: Button appears for CDO users  
✅ **Navigation**: Route works and displays assignments  
✅ **Data Display**: Shows attribute and data provider details correctly  

## Usage Example
When a GBM CDO logs in and views their assignments, they can see:
- Which attributes they assigned data providers for
- Who they assigned as the data provider for each attribute
- When the assignments were made
- Current status of each assignment

This provides full visibility into the CDO's data provider assignment activities for audit and tracking purposes.
