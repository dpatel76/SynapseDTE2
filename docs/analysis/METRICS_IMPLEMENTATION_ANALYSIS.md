# Metrics Implementation Analysis & Gap Assessment

## Current State vs Requirements

### (1) METRICS - PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION ⚠️

#### Tester Dashboard Metrics
**Required vs Implemented:**
- ✅ Aggregate metrics (reports assigned, completed, observations)
- ❌ Missing exact phase-specific metrics as specified

**Gap Analysis by Phase:**

**Planning Phase:**
- Required: total attributes, approved attributes, completion time, on-time
- Current: Has attributes but missing completion time and on-time metrics

**Data Profiling Phase:**
- Required: total attributes, approved rules, no DQ issues, anomalies, completion time, submissions, on-time
- Current: ❌ No DataProfilingPhaseMetrics component created

**Scoping Phase:**
- Required: total attributes, PKs, non-PK scoped, completion time, submissions, on-time  
- Current: Has some metrics but missing PKs, non-PK breakdown, completion time

**Sample Selection Phase:**
- Required: non-PK scoped attributes, samples approved, LOBs, completion time, submissions, on-time
- Current: Missing non-PK specific metrics, completion time

**Data Owner ID Phase:**
- Required: non-PK scoped, samples approved, LOBs, providers assigned, changes, on-time
- Current: Missing changes to data providers metric

**Request Info Phase:**
- Required: non-PK scoped, samples, LOBs, test cases, RFI completed/pending, changes, completion time, on-time
- Current: Missing test case breakdowns, RFI status

**Testing Phase:**
- Required: non-PK scoped, samples, LOBs, test cases, completed, pass/fail, reupload required, completion time, on-time
- Current: Missing reupload required metric

**Observation Management Phase:**
- Required: non-PK scoped, samples, LOBs, test cases with observations, observations, approved, samples/attributes impacted, completion time, on-time
- Current: Missing samples/attributes impacted metrics

#### Report Testing Summary Tables
- ❌ Not implemented - Need three separate tables:
  - Sample Metrics with LOB breakdown
  - Attribute Metrics with LOB breakdown
  - Test Case Metrics with LOB breakdown

#### Other Role Dashboards
- ✅ Created dashboards for all roles
- ⚠️ But using mock data, not actual calculations

### (2) STATUS HANDLING - NEEDS VERIFICATION ⚠️

**Current Implementation:**
- Activity states exist but need to verify:
  - Manual Start/Complete Phase restricted to tester
  - Auto-progression between activities
  - Standardized names across phases
  - Standardized states (Not Started, In Progress, Complete, Revision Requested)

### (3) VERSIONING - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ⚠️

**Current State:**
- ✅ VersionHistoryViewer component exists
- ❌ Not integrated into all phase pages
- ❌ Version dropdown not visible on phase pages
- ❌ Approved version tagging not visible in UI

### (4) LLM INTEGRATION - NEEDS VERIFICATION ⚠️

**Current State:**
- ✅ Regulation-specific prompts exist in prompts/regulatory/
- ❌ Need to verify report.regulation field is used for prompt selection
- ❌ Need to verify batch parameters are in config, not hardcoded

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Metrics Implementation
1. Create DataProfilingPhaseMetrics component
2. Update all phase metrics to include exact required fields
3. Add completion time and on-time metrics to all phases
4. Create Report Testing Summary component with three tables
5. Update backend to calculate actual metrics (not mock data)

### Phase 2: Verify and Fix Status Handling
1. Audit all phase pages for activity state management
2. Ensure Start/Complete Phase is restricted to tester
3. Implement auto-progression logic
4. Standardize all activity names
5. Ensure all states use the standard four states

### Phase 3: Complete Versioning UI
1. Add version dropdown to all phase pages
2. Show approved version indicator
3. Ensure working on latest version
4. Add version history access

### Phase 4: Verify LLM Integration
1. Check regulation field usage in prompt selection
2. Move all batch sizes to configuration
3. Verify batching is used for long operations
4. Add regulation mapping configuration

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Don't hardcode metric calculations - use database queries
2. Don't mix activity states with phase status
3. Don't allow state transitions without proper validation
4. Don't hardcode LLM batch sizes
5. Don't forget to show LOB-level breakdowns
6. Don't show all metrics to all roles - filter by role
7. Don't forget completion time tracking
8. Don't mix versions - always work on latest
