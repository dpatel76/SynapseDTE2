# Dynamic Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive dynamic workflow system where ALL activities are Temporal activities, configurable via database templates.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements
- **Added to `workflow_activity_templates`:**
  - `handler_name` - Specifies which handler class processes the activity
  - `timeout_seconds` - Activity timeout configuration
  - `retry_policy` - JSON retry configuration
  - `conditional_expression` - Activity execution conditions
  - `execution_mode` - Sequential or parallel execution

- **Added to `workflow_activities`:**
  - `instance_id` - Unique identifier for parallel instances
  - `parent_activity_id` - Activity dependency tracking
  - `execution_mode` - Runtime execution mode
  - `retry_count` - Retry tracking
  - `last_error` - Error tracking

### 2. Activity Templates Configuration
- **Total Activities:** 49 across 9 phases
- **Manual Activities:** 20 (requiring human interaction)
- **Automated Activities:** 29 (system-executed)
- **Parallel Activities:** 14 (in 3 phases)

### 3. Handler Distribution
- **ManualActivityHandler:** 20 activities (all manual tasks)
- **AutomatedActivityHandler:** 18 activities (START/COMPLETE)
- **Specialized Handlers:** 11 activities
  - GenerateAttributesHandler
  - DataProfilingHandler
  - ExecuteScopingHandler
  - GenerateSamplesHandler
  - SendDataRequestHandler
  - ValidateDataUploadHandler
  - GenerateTestCasesHandler
  - ExecuteTestsHandler
  - CreateObservationsHandler
  - GenerateReportSectionsHandler
  - GenerateFinalReportHandler

### 4. Workflow Phases

#### Sequential Phases (6):
1. **Planning** - 6 activities
2. **Data Profiling** - 5 activities
3. **Scoping** - 5 activities
4. **Sample Selection** - 5 activities
5. **Data Owner Identification** - 5 activities
6. **Finalize Test Report** - 6 activities

#### Parallel Phases (3):
1. **Request for Information** - 6 activities (5 parallel by data owner)
2. **Test Execution** - 5 activities (4 parallel by document)
3. **Observation Management** - 6 activities (5 parallel by test execution)

### 5. Key Features Implemented

#### Activity Handler Framework
- Base handler class with dependency management
- Activity registry for dynamic handler lookup
- Support for manual and automated activities
- Compensation logic for rollback scenarios

#### Dynamic Activity Execution
- Generic Temporal activity that delegates to handlers
- Instance-based execution for parallel activities
- Dependency checking before execution
- Signal-based completion for manual activities

#### Enhanced Workflow V2
- Loads activities dynamically from database
- Respects sequential and parallel execution modes
- Handles activity dependencies
- Supports workflow versioning

### 6. Retry and Timeout Configuration
- **Manual Activities:**
  - Approval tasks: 48 hours timeout
  - Review tasks: 24 hours timeout
  - Regular tasks: 24 hours timeout
  - No automatic retries (handled manually)

- **Automated Activities:**
  - Generate/Execute tasks: 15-30 minutes timeout
  - START/COMPLETE: 1 minute timeout
  - Default: 5 minutes timeout
  - 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff

### 7. Activity Dependencies
- 17 core dependencies configured
- Dependencies ensure proper workflow sequencing
- Support for approval-based progression
- Conditional execution support

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Flexibility:** Add/remove activities without code changes
2. **Visibility:** All activities tracked in Temporal
3. **Consistency:** Unified activity handling
4. **Scalability:** Parallel execution support
5. **Reliability:** Retry policies and error handling
6. **Maintainability:** Handler-based architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Handler unit tests
   - Parallel execution verification

2. **Migration:**
   - Migrate existing workflows to V2
   - Update frontend to use new activity structure
   - Phase out legacy workflow implementations

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Add metrics for activity execution
   - Implement activity performance tracking
   - Create dashboards for workflow visibility

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/app/temporal/activities/activity_handler.py` - Handler framework
- `/app/temporal/activities/dynamic_activities.py` - Generic executor
- `/app/temporal/activities/handlers/*.py` - Phase-specific handlers
- `/app/temporal/workflows/enhanced_test_cycle_workflow_v2.py` - V2 workflow
- `/app/temporal/worker_v2.py` - Updated worker
- Various migration and population scripts

### Database Changes:
- Enhanced `workflow_activity_templates` table
- Enhanced `workflow_activities` table
- Created `workflow_activity_dependencies` table
- Added indexes for performance

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a fully dynamic, database-driven workflow system that maintains backward compatibility while enabling future flexibility.
