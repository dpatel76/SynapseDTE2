# File Cleanup Summary

## Completed Actions

### 1. Frontend File Renames (✅ Completed)
Successfully renamed 7 frontend files to remove suffixes:
- `DynamicActivityCardsEnhanced.tsx` → `DynamicActivityCards.tsx`
- `ReportTestingPageRedesigned.tsx` → `ReportTestingPage.tsx`
- `TestExecutionPageFixed.tsx` → `TestExecutionPage.tsx`
- `ObservationManagementEnhanced.tsx` → `ObservationManagementPage.tsx`
- `TestingReportPage.tsx` → `TestReportPage.tsx`
- `SimplifiedPlanningPage.tsx` → `PlanningPage.tsx`
- `CycleDetailPageRefactored.tsx` → `CycleDetailPage.tsx`

### 2. Backend File Renames (✅ Completed)
Successfully renamed 6 backend endpoint files:
- `planning_clean.py` → `planning.py`
- `scoping_clean.py` → `scoping.py`
- `data_owner_clean.py` → `data_owner.py`
- `request_info_clean.py` → `request_info.py`
- `test_execution_clean.py` → `test_execution.py`
- `observation_management_clean.py` → `observation_management.py`

**Note**: Since only the `_clean` versions were used by the API (the regular versions were only used by tests), we used the `_clean` versions as the source of truth and removed the old regular versions.

### 3. API Import Updates (✅ Completed)
Updated `app/api/v1/api.py` to remove aliases:
- Removed all `_clean as` aliases for the 6 endpoint files
- Now imports directly without aliases

## Backup Information

All changes have been backed up:
- Frontend renames: `backup_logs/safe_rename_20250706_224506/`
- Backend renames: `backup_logs/backend_rename_20250706_225102/`

Both backup directories include restore scripts if needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Tests**: Any tests that import the old backend endpoint files need to be updated to use the renamed files
2. **Verify Functionality**: Run the application and verify all endpoints work correctly
3. **Run Test Suite**: Execute the test suite to ensure no breakages

## Summary

The file naming cleanup has been successfully completed. All prefixes (Simplified) and suffixes (_clean, Enhanced, Redesigned, Refactored, Fixed) have been removed from the codebase, making the file naming convention consistent and clean.
