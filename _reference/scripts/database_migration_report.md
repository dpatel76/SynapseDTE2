# Database Migration Report

## Overview
This report documents the database migration process for creating a test database for SynapseDTE.

## Database Analysis

### Source Database: synapse_dt
- **Total Tables**: 40+ tables identified in the models
- **Database Type**: PostgreSQL with asyncpg driver
- **Key Features**: 
  - RBAC with 7 roles and 50+ permissions
  - 7-phase workflow management
  - Comprehensive audit trails
  - LLM integration tracking

### Test Database: synapse_dt_test

## Migration Results

### Successfully Created Tables
1. **lobs** - Lines of Business
   - Source: 8 records
   - Test: 4 records (basic seed data)

2. **roles** - RBAC roles
   - Source: 7 records
   - Test: 5 records (core roles)

3. **users** - System users
   - Source: 20 records
   - Test: 4 records (test users)

4. **test_cycles** - Testing cycles
   - Source: 27 records
   - Test: 0 records (ready for testing)

5. **reports** - Regulatory reports
   - Source: 21 records
   - Test: 0 records (ready for testing)

6. **workflow_phases** - Workflow phase tracking
   - Source: 180 records
   - Test: 0 records (ready for testing)

### Key Database Components

#### 1. ENUM Types Created
- `userrole`: 7 user roles (Tester, Test Executive, etc.)
- `workflowstate`: Workflow states
- `workflow_phase_enum`: 10 workflow phases
- `workflow_phase_state_enum`: Progress tracking
- `workflow_phase_status_enum`: Schedule adherence

#### 2. Seed Data Created

**LOBs (Lines of Business)**:
- Retail Banking
- Commercial Banking
- Investment Banking
- Wealth Management

**Roles**:
- Admin - System administrator
- Tester - Executes testing activities
- Test Executive - Oversees testing operations
- Report Owner - Owns specific regulatory reports
- Data Owner - Provides data for testing

**Test Users**:
- admin@example.com (Admin role)
- tester1@example.com (Tester role)
- test.manager@example.com (Test Executive role)
- report.owner1@example.com (Report Owner role)

All test users have password: `password123`

## Migration Scripts Created

### 1. `create_test_database.py`
- Comprehensive migration with all tables and seed data
- Issue: Complex foreign key dependencies caused transaction failures

### 2. `create_test_database_simple.py`
- Simplified approach with ordered table creation
- Issue: SQLAlchemy metadata conflicts with async transactions

### 3. `test_db_simple.py` ✅
- Direct SQL approach using asyncpg
- Successfully creates test database with basic structure
- Provides reconciliation report comparing source and test databases

## Test Database Connection

```bash
postgresql://synapse_user:synapse_password@localhost:5432/synapse_dt_test
```

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Schema**: Add remaining tables using the ordered approach
2. **Complete Seed Data**: Add permissions, role mappings, and workflow configurations
3. **Data Migration**: Optionally copy reference data from source database
4. **Validation**: Run application tests against test database

## Recommendations

1. **Use Alembic**: For production migrations, use Alembic with proper dependency ordering
2. **Separate Transactions**: Create tables and seed data in separate transactions
3. **Constraint Deferral**: Consider deferring foreign key constraints during initial setup
4. **Test Coverage**: Ensure all RBAC permissions and workflow states are properly seeded

## Summary

The test database `synapse_dt_test` has been successfully created with:
- ✅ Basic table structure (6 core tables)
- ✅ All required ENUM types
- ✅ Initial seed data for LOBs, roles, and users
- ✅ Reconciliation report showing data comparison

The database is ready for development and testing purposes.
