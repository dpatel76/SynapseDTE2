# The correct flow should be:
# 1. Update activity to IN_PROGRESS (but DON'T commit yet)
# 2. If it's a START activity, immediately update to COMPLETED
# 3. Run any initialization logic
# 4. THEN commit everything together
# 5. If initialization fails, the whole transaction rolls back

The issue with START activities not auto-completing is due to incorrect transaction handling.

Current flow (BROKEN):
1. Update activity to IN_PROGRESS
2. Commit (line 271) <-- This saves IN_PROGRESS
3. Try to auto-complete START activities
4. If initialization fails, activity stays IN_PROGRESS

Correct flow (FIXED):
1. Update activity to IN_PROGRESS
2. If START activity, immediately update to COMPLETED (no commit)
3. Run initialization logic (no commit)
4. Commit everything at the end
5. If anything fails, entire transaction rolls back

The key issue is the commit on line 271 happens BEFORE the auto-completion logic.
This means if initialization fails, the activity is stuck in IN_PROGRESS.
