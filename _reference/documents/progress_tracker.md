## Risk Assessment

### ✅ Resolved Risks
- Database connectivity and schema complexity
- Primary key conflicts and relationship issues
- Authentication token management
- FastAPI dependency parameter ordering
- LLM integration architecture
- SQLAlchemy metadata conflicts
- Sample generation and validation logic
- Testing execution complexity with LLM document analysis
- Observation management auto-detection and resolution tracking

### ⚠️ Current Risks (Medium Priority)
- Frontend state management complexity for 7-phase workflow
- Real-time notifications and WebSocket integration
- Database performance optimization at scale
- User experience design for complex workflows
- Production deployment and scalability

### 🎯 Mitigation Strategies
- React Context API and Redux for state management architecture
- WebSocket implementation for real-time progress updates
- Database indexing optimization and query performance tuning
- User experience testing and iterative UI refinement
- Docker containerization and Kubernetes orchestration planning
