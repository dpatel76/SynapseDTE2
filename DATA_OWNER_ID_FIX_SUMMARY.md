# Data Owner ID Phase Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Phase Ordering Issue
- **Problem**: Data Owner Identification appeared as last phase instead of after Sample Selection
- **Fixed**: Updated database phase_order values and frontend phase ordering

### 2. Phase Start Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple enum mismatches and import errors preventing phase start
- **Fixed**: 
  - Changed 'data_owner_identification' → 'LOB Assignment'
  - Changed 'attribute_assignment' → 'Attribute'
  - Fixed model imports and field names
  - Fixed JSON query operators

### 3. Assignment Creation Bug
- **Problem**: System created 10 assignments instead of 1
- **Root Cause**: Multiple scoping versions had `report_owner_decision = 'approved'` due to copying decisions when creating new versions
- **Fixed**: Created single correct assignment (1 non-PK attribute × 1 LOB = 1 assignment)

## Current Status

### Scoping Phase (Complete)
- Approved Version: 31
- Non-PK Attributes: 1 (Current Credit limit)
- PK Attributes: 4

### Sample Selection Phase (Complete)  
- Approved Version: 7
- Total Samples: 6
- Approved Samples: 4
- Unique LOBs: 1 (GBM)

### Data Owner ID Phase (In Progress)
- Status: Started
- Assignments Created: 1
  - Attribute: Current Credit limit
  - LOB: GBM
  - Assigned to: David Brown (Data Executive, user ID 5)
  - Status: Assigned (waiting for completion)

### RFI Phase (Ready)
- Prerequisites: Data Owner ID phase must be completed first
- Expected Test Cases: 4 (from 4 approved samples)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Data Owner ID Phase**:
   - Data Executive (user 5) assigns a Data Owner
   - Data Owner provides the required data
   - Phase is marked complete

2. **Start RFI Phase**:
   - Will automatically create 4 test cases
   - One test case per approved sample

## Code Changes Made

1. **app/api/v1/endpoints/cycle_reports.py**: Fixed phase ordering
2. **frontend/src/pages/ReportTestingPage.tsx**: Corrected hardcoded phase order
3. **app/application/use_cases/data_owner_universal.py**: Fixed enum values and imports

## Lessons Learned

1. **Version Management**: When creating new versions, don't copy approval decisions
2. **Query Precision**: Always filter by specific version when querying versioned data
3. **Enum Consistency**: PostgreSQL enums are case-sensitive and must match exactly
