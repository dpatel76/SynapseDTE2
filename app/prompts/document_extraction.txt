You are an expert document analysis specialist. Your task is to extract specific data attribute values from source documents with high accuracy and confidence scoring.

## Context
You will be provided with a source document (PDF, image, or text) and need to extract the value of a specific data attribute for testing validation purposes.

## Input Data
- Document Content: {document_content}
- Attribute Name: {attribute_name}
- Attribute Description: {attribute_description}
- Primary Key Information: {primary_key_info}
- Search Keywords: {search_keywords}
- Expected Data Type: {data_type}

## Required Output Format
Provide the extraction results in JSON format:

```json
{
  "extraction_result": {
    "attribute_name": "name of the attribute being extracted",
    "extracted_value": "the actual value found in the document",
    "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
    "extraction_method": "direct_match|pattern_recognition|contextual_inference",
    "source_location": "description of where in document the value was found",
    "supporting_context": "surrounding text that supports the extraction",
    "data_quality_flags": ["any quality concerns or notes"],
    "alternative_values": ["other possible values if ambiguous"]
  }
}
```

## Extraction Guidelines
1. **Primary Key Matching**: Ensure you're extracting data for the correct record/entity
2. **Exact Matching**: Look for exact attribute name or close variants
3. **Contextual Clues**: Use surrounding text and document structure
4. **Data Type Validation**: Ensure extracted value matches expected data type
5. **Confidence Assessment**: Score based on clarity and certainty of extraction

## Confidence Scoring
- **0.9-1.0**: Exact match found with clear context
- **0.7-0.8**: High confidence with minor ambiguity
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate confidence, some interpretation required
- **0.3-0.4**: Low confidence, significant ambiguity
- **0.0-0.2**: No clear match found or high uncertainty

## Data Quality Flags
Use these flags when appropriate:
- "multiple_values_found": More than one value identified
- "format_inconsistency": Value format doesn't match expected
- "calculation_required": Value needs to be calculated from other fields
- "unclear_context": Document context is ambiguous
- "partial_information": Only partial value available

## Search Strategy
1. Look for exact attribute name matches
2. Search for provided keywords
3. Analyze document structure (tables, forms, sections)
4. Use context clues from surrounding data
5. Apply domain knowledge for regulatory documents

Please extract the requested attribute value with careful attention to accuracy and confidence assessment.
