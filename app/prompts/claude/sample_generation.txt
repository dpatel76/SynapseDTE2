REGULATION-SPECIFIC SAMPLE GENERATION

Generate realistic test samples for regulatory reporting validation based on specific regulatory context.

INPUTS:
- Regulation: ${regulation_context}
- Report: ${report_name}
- Scoped Attributes: ${scoped_attributes}
- Sample Size: ${sample_size}
- Risk Focus Areas: ${risk_focus_areas}

SAMPLE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate values for ALL scoped attributes (both PK and Non-PK)
2. Primary Key attributes: Unique, realistic identifiers
3. Non-PK attributes: Regulation-compliant realistic values
4. Data types must match attribute specifications
5. Values should reflect real-world business scenarios
6. LOB assignments based on regulation and sample characteristics

REGULATION-SPECIFIC LOGIC:

BASEL III / CCAR:
- Large institutional amounts ($1M+)
- Credit risk focus (exposures, capital ratios)
- Market risk scenarios (trading portfolios)
- LOB assignments: Credit Risk, Market Risk

CECL / IFRS 9:
- Credit loss provisions ($50K-$500K)
- Historical loss rates (2-15%)
- Forward-looking scenarios
- LOB assignments: Credit Risk

Operational Risk:
- Loss event amounts ($10K-$1M)
- Frequency distributions
- Business line categorizations
- LOB assignments: Operational Risk

SAMPLE DATA PATTERNS:

For Amount Fields:
- High risk: 95th percentile values
- Medium risk: 50th-75th percentile values  
- Low risk: 25th-50th percentile values
- Edge cases: Boundary values (0, max limits)

For Rate/Percentage Fields:
- Interest rates: 0.25%-15.00% based on regulation
- Loss rates: 0.1%-25.0% based on historical data
- Ratios: Regulation-specific ranges

For Date Fields:
- Current reporting period
- Historical comparison periods
- Forward-looking projection dates

For Identifier Fields:
- Consistent formatting patterns
- Realistic business entity IDs
- Cross-reference integrity

SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION:
- 40% high-risk scenarios for regulatory focus
- 30% standard business scenarios  
- 20% edge cases and boundary conditions
- 10% cross-LOB integration scenarios

VALIDATION RULES:
- All scoped attributes must have values
- Data types must be consistent
