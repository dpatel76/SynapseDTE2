You are a meticulous regulatory compliance analyst. Your task is to generate a COMPLETE and EXHAUSTIVE list of ALL attribute names required for regulatory testing.

INPUTS:
- Regulation: ${regulation}
- Report/Schedule: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Context: ${regulatory_context}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate a MINIMUM of 80 attributes (typical reports need 100-300)
2. If the report naturally has fewer than 80 attributes, generate ALL attributes that exist
3. If the report has more than 300 attributes, focus on the 300 most critical ones
4. Think systematically through EVERY section of the regulatory report
5. Include ALL data points that would appear in the actual regulatory filing

SYSTEMATIC APPROACH - Work through these categories:

1. ENTITY & IDENTIFICATION (Generate 10-25 attributes):
   Start with: entity_id, customer_id, account_number, loan_number
   Then add: borrower_name, co_borrower_id, guarantor_id, subsidiary_id
   Include: external_reference_id, legacy_account_number, portfolio_id, facility_id
   Don't forget: parent_company_id, relationship_id, group_id, consolidation_id

2. FINANCIAL AMOUNTS (Generate 20-40 attributes):
   Principal: original_principal_amount, current_principal_balance, scheduled_principal_payment
   Interest: interest_rate, current_interest_rate, accrued_interest, interest_paid_ytd
   Payments: scheduled_payment_amount, actual_payment_amount, prepayment_amount
   Balances: beginning_balance, ending_balance, average_daily_balance
   Fees: origination_fee, servicing_fee, late_fee, prepayment_penalty

3. DATES & TIMING (Generate 15-25 attributes):
   Origination: origination_date, first_payment_date, first_interest_date
   Maturity: maturity_date, final_payment_date, balloon_payment_date
   Activity: last_payment_date, next_payment_date, last_activity_date
   Status: default_date, charge_off_date, recovery_date, modification_date

4. STATUS & CLASSIFICATION (Generate 15-30 attributes):
   Status: account_status, payment_status, delinquency_status, collection_status
   Risk: risk_rating, credit_score, probability_of_default, loss_given_default
   Product: product_type, product_code, loan_purpose, collateral_type
   Geography: country_code, state_code, msa_code, county_code, zip_code

5. REGULATORY FIELDS (Generate 10-20 attributes):
   Flags: regulatory_classification, basel_category, qualified_mortgage_flag
   Compliance: hmda_reportable, cra_eligible, fair_lending_flag
   Capital: risk_weight_percent, capital_requirement, regulatory_capital_ratio

6. PERFORMANCE METRICS (Generate 10-20 attributes):
   Delinquency: days_past_due, months_delinquent, delinquency_bucket
   Utilization: utilization_rate, payment_to_income_ratio, debt_to_income_ratio
   Quality: nonaccrual_flag, troubled_debt_restructuring_flag, modification_flag

7. ADDITIONAL FIELDS (Generate remaining to reach minimum 80):
   Collateral: collateral_value, appraisal_date, loan_to_value_ratio
   Provisions: allowance_amount, specific_provision, general_provision
   Other: call_report_code, schedule_code, line_item_number

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON array of lowercase attribute names with underscores.
START with [ and END with ]
Do NOT include explanations or markdown.

EXAMPLE:
[
  "entity_id",
  "customer_id",
  "account_number",
  ... (continue until you have AT LEAST 80 attributes)
]

REMEMBER: Generate AT LEAST 80 attributes. It's better to be comprehensive than to miss important fields.
