Suggest the database table and column for the given report attribute.

CONTEXT:
- Report: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Context: ${regulatory_context}

ATTRIBUTE TO MAP:
- Name: ${attribute_name}
- Description: ${attribute_description}
- Data Type: ${data_type}
- Mandatory Flag: ${mandatory_flag}
- Is Primary Key: ${is_primary_key}

AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES WITH SCHEMA:
${data_sources}

TASK:
Based on the attribute information above and the ACTUAL DATABASE SCHEMA provided for each data source, identify the most appropriate table and column to map this attribute to.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST ONLY suggest columns that ACTUALLY EXIST in the schema_summary provided above
- DO NOT use any knowledge about database schemas outside of what is explicitly provided
- DO NOT suggest system tables or columns (those starting with cycle_report_, activity_, workflow_, etc.)
- If you cannot find a suitable match in the provided schema, return null for source_field
- Look for column names that semantically match the attribute
- Consider data type compatibility
- For primary keys, prefer columns marked as (PK)

Please suggest:
1. The data source ID where you found the best match
2. The EXACT fully qualified column name as it appears in the schema (schema.table.column)
3. Your confidence in this mapping (0-100)
4. Brief rationale explaining why this specific column from the provided schema is the best match

REMEMBER: The source_field MUST be one of the columns shown in the schema_summary above. Do not suggest columns that are not explicitly listed.

Return as JSON:
{
    "data_source_id": number,
    "source_field": "schema.table_name.column_name OR just column_name",
    "table_name": "table_name (optional, extracted from schema)",
    "column_name": "column_name (the actual column name)",
    "confidence_score": number,
    "rationale": "Explanation referencing the actual column found in the schema",
    "alternative_mappings": [
        {
            "data_source_id": number,
            "source_field": "schema.table_name.column_name OR just column_name",
            "confidence_score": number,
            "rationale": "string"
        }
    ]
}

Note: If the data source only contains one table, you may return just the column name in source_field. The system will automatically qualify it with the table name.
