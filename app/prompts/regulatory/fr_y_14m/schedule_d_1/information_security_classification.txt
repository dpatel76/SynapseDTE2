FR Y-14M D.1 SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

1. CRITICALITY LEVELS:
   HIGH:
   - Account identifiers (ACCT_NUM, CUST_ID, CUSIP_NUM)
   - Credit scores (ORIG_FICO, CURR_FICO, BEHAV_SCORE)
   - Balance and payment fields critical for stress testing
   - Risk metrics (PD, LGD, EAD fields)
   
   MEDIUM:
   - Transaction amounts and dates
   - APR and rate fields
   - Fee information
   - Geographic data (STATE, ZIP_CODE)
   
   LOW:
   - Descriptive fields
   - Status flags (unless regulatory)
   - Derived calculations

2. RISK LEVELS:
   HIGH:
   - PII fields (SSN, full account numbers if unmasked)
   - Credit bureau scores
   - Income information
   - Fields with regulatory penalties for errors
   
   MEDIUM:
   - Payment history
   - Balance information
   - Rate information
   - Geographic identifiers
   
   LOW:
   - Aggregated data
   - Public information
   - System-generated flags

3. REGULATORY FLAGS:
   - Required for FR Y-14M submission: YES
   - Subject to CCAR validation: YES
   - Part of stress testing models: Check if used in DFAST/CCAR
   - Privacy regulations: GLBA, FCRA, Reg P
   - Data retention: Federal Reserve 5-year requirement

4. PII/SENSITIVE DATA:
   - Account numbers (must be hashed/masked)
   - Customer IDs (if linkable to individuals)
   - ZIP codes (quasi-identifier)
   - Income data
   - Credit scores
   - Payment behavior

5. INFORMATION SECURITY CLASSIFICATION WITH SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:

   PUBLIC (Information that can be freely shared or is publicly available):
   - Reporting period identifiers (Period ID, ASOFDT, reporting cycle dates)
   - Standard geographic codes (State abbreviations, public ZIP codes)
   - Published regulatory requirements and instructions
   - Publicly available company information
   - Standard data element definitions from public regulatory guidance
   - Generic product categories available in public disclosures
   
   PROPRIETARY (Internal business information with competitive value):
   - Internal process codes and system identifiers
   - Business unit classifications and internal organizational data
   - Internal risk model methodologies (not the results)
   - Geographic segmentation for business purposes
   - Collateral type classifications
   - Internal workflow and process identifiers
   - Non-sensitive account status flags
   
   CONFIDENTIAL (Sensitive business/customer data requiring protection):
   - Customer names and masked identifiers
   - Account balances and payment amounts
   - Interest rates and fee structures
   - Payment history and delinquency status
   - Income data and employment information
   - Aggregated portfolio metrics
   - Non-public financial performance data
   
   HRCI (Highly Restricted Confidential Information - Most sensitive data):
   - Social Security Numbers (SSN)
   - Full, unmasked account numbers
   - Credit bureau scores (FICO, VantageScore)
   - Proprietary internal credit scores
   - Individual customer risk ratings
   - Non-public regulatory examination findings
   - Sensitive model parameters and outputs

6. FEDERAL RESERVE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
   - Data Quality: Must meet Federal Reserve data quality standards
   - Completeness: Missing data impacts stress test results
   - Accuracy: Errors can invalidate CCAR submissions
   - Timeliness: Must reflect as-of cycle date

CLASSIFICATION DECISION LOGIC:
1. Start with the lowest classification level that protects the data appropriately
2. For basic identifiers (periods, states, generic codes): Consider PUBLIC first
3. For internal business codes: Consider PROPRIETARY  
4. For customer data or financial amounts: Consider CONFIDENTIAL
5. For highly sensitive PII or regulatory-restricted data: Use HRCI
6. Always justify the classification with specific reasoning

Please classify with consideration for:
1. Impact on stress testing accuracy
2. Regulatory reporting requirements
3. Privacy and security regulations
4. Historical examination findings
5. Cross-field dependencies
