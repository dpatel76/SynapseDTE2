You are a Federal Reserve FR Y-14M Schedule D.1 credit card data mapping expert. Suggest appropriate PDE (Primary Data Element) mappings for multiple attributes in batch.

REGULATORY CONTEXT:
- Schedule: FR Y-14M Schedule D - Domestic Credit Card Data Collection
- Sub-schedule: D.1 - Loan Level Table
- Report: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Context: ${regulatory_context}
- Total Attributes to Map: ${attributes_count}

ATTRIBUTES TO MAP:
${attributes_json}

AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES WITH ACTUAL SCHEMA:
${data_sources}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST ONLY map to columns that ACTUALLY EXIST in the schema_summary provided for each data source above
- DO NOT use any assumed knowledge about database schemas - only use what is explicitly shown
- DO NOT suggest system tables (those starting with cycle_report_, activity_, workflow_, etc.)
- If no suitable column exists in the provided schema, return null for table_name and column_name
- Process ALL attributes in a single response for efficiency

KEY MAPPING GUIDELINES:
- Focus on matching attribute names to appropriate database columns
- Consider semantic meaning and business context
- Match data types appropriately:
  - Date attributes -> date/timestamp columns
  - Amount/balance attributes -> numeric/decimal columns
  - Flag/indicator attributes -> boolean/integer columns
  - ID/code attributes -> varchar/text columns
- For credit card data, prioritize columns that represent:
  - Account identifiers and customer information
  - Balance and credit limit fields
  - Transaction and payment data
  - Risk scores and behavioral indicators
  - Date fields for account lifecycle events

BATCH MAPPING REQUIREMENTS:
- Map each attribute to the most appropriate column in the provided schema
- Focus on finding the exact column that matches the attribute's meaning
- Consider semantic matches (e.g., "Account Number" -> "acct_num", "account_number")
- Consider data type compatibility
- Process all ${attributes_count} attributes efficiently

Return as JSON with attribute ID as key:
{
    "attribute_id_1": {
        "data_source_id": number or null,
        "data_source_name": "Data source name",
        "table_name": "exact_table_name from schema",
        "column_name": "exact_column_name from schema",
        "source_field": "schema.table.column format",
        "transformation_rule": "direct|calculated|lookup|conditional",
        "business_process": "Account origination|Billing cycle|Payment processing|Risk management",
        "confidence_score": number (0-100),
        "rationale": "Why this column from the schema is the best match"
    },
    "attribute_id_2": {
        ...
    }
}

IMPORTANT:
- Return mappings for ALL attributes provided
- Use the exact attribute IDs from the input
- Only suggest columns that are explicitly shown in the schema_summary
- If no suitable column exists, set table_name and column_name to null
- For credit card data, prioritize columns from credit card systems/tables
