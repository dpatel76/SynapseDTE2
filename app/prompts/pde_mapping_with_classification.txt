Suggest the database table and column for the given report attribute AND classify it for information security and regulatory compliance.

CONTEXT:
- Report: ${report_name}
- Regulatory Context: ${regulatory_context}

ATTRIBUTE TO MAP:
- Name: ${attribute_name}
- Description: ${attribute_description}
- Data Type: ${data_type}
- Mandatory Flag: ${mandatory_flag}
- Is Primary Key: ${is_primary_key}
- CDE Flag: ${cde_flag}
- Historical Issues Flag: ${historical_issues_flag}

AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES WITH SCHEMA:
${data_sources}

TASK 1 - MAPPING:
Based on the attribute information above and the ACTUAL DATABASE SCHEMA provided for each data source, identify the most appropriate table and column to map this attribute to.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST ONLY suggest columns that ACTUALLY EXIST in the schema_summary provided above
- DO NOT use any knowledge about database schemas outside of what is explicitly provided
- DO NOT suggest system tables or columns (those starting with cycle_report_, activity_, workflow_, etc.)
- If you cannot find a suitable match in the provided schema, return null for source_field
- Look for column names that semantically match the attribute
- Consider data type compatibility
- For primary keys, prefer columns marked as (PK)

TASK 2 - CLASSIFICATION:
Analyze the attribute for information security classification and regulatory compliance based on:
1. The attribute name and description
2. The data type and characteristics (PK, CDE, mandatory, etc.)
3. The regulatory context of the report
4. Common regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, etc.)

INFORMATION SECURITY CLASSIFICATIONS:
- HRCI: Highly Restricted Confidential Information (e.g., SSN, credit card numbers, sensitive PII)
- Confidential: Confidential business information (e.g., customer data, financial data)
- Proprietary: Proprietary company information (e.g., internal identifiers, business logic)
- Public: Public information (e.g., published reports, non-sensitive reference data)

Return as JSON with both mapping and classification:
{
    "data_source_id": number,
    "source_field": "schema.table_name.column_name OR just column_name",
    "table_name": "table_name (optional, extracted from schema)",
    "column_name": "column_name (the actual column name)",
    "confidence_score": number,
    "rationale": "Explanation referencing the actual column found in the schema",
    "alternative_mappings": [
        {
            "data_source_id": number,
            "source_field": "schema.table_name.column_name OR just column_name",
            "confidence_score": number,
            "rationale": "string"
        }
    ],
    "information_security_classification": "HRCI|Confidential|Proprietary|Public",
    "criticality": "High|Medium|Low",
    "risk_level": "High|Medium|Low",
    "regulatory_flag": boolean,
    "pii_flag": boolean,
    "regulatory_references": ["List of applicable regulations"],
    "classification_rationale": "Detailed explanation of security classification",
    "evidence": {
        "data_sensitivity_indicators": ["List of indicators"],
        "regulatory_scope": ["List of regulations"],
        "business_impact": "Description of impact"
    }
}

IMPORTANT:
- The source_field MUST be one of the columns shown in the schema_summary above
- Consider the regulatory context when determining classification
- Flag any attributes that contain PII or are subject to regulatory requirements
- Provide clear rationale for both mapping and classification decisions
