# RFI Test Case Creation - Complete Summary

## Test Results: ✅ SUCCESS

I have successfully tested RFI test case creation as requested. Here are the results:

### Prerequisites Completed
1. **Data Owner ID Phase**: Completed successfully
   - Phase status changed from "In Progress" to "Complete"
   - 1 assignment was correctly created (1 non-PK attribute × 1 LOB)

2. **RFI Phase**: Started successfully
   - Phase status: "In Progress"
   - Phase ID: 470

### Test Case Creation Results
**4 test cases were successfully created** from the 4 approved samples:

1. **TC-001**: Test Case for 60YGHQ2RZ3FSH6OQMW (GBM)
   - Sample ID: b67361a9-f452-4881-b332-47c6d68bdb56
   - Status: Not Started

2. **TC-002**: Test Case for E4LZGN2AUHCTISS7O9 (GBM)
   - Sample ID: c46182f1-7bd7-4ff2-9277-7f579b5d800e
   - Status: Not Started

3. **TC-003**: Test Case for FQPU17NX1RMB50TV0G (GBM)
   - Sample ID: 9673ad10-dd55-48bb-8f2e-a10a82d36efb
   - Status: Not Started

4. **TC-004**: Test Case for TXZK9TIGFWHHPPFWBH (GBM)
   - Sample ID: d47f7df2-dba9-4277-be66-5fffb363731c
   - Status: Not Started

### Technical Details
- Test cases were stored in the `cycle_report_test_cases` table
- Each test case links to an approved sample from the Sample Selection phase
- All test cases are for the GBM (Global Banking & Markets) LOB
- Test cases have status "Not Started" (using the correct enum value)

### Key Fixes Applied
1. Fixed enum value from "pending" to "Not Started" for test case status
2. Converted UUID sample_id to string for proper storage
3. Used sample_identifier instead of non-existent account_number field

## Conclusion
The RFI test case creation has been successfully tested. The system correctly:
- Created 4 test cases (as expected)
- Linked each test case to an approved sample
- Set appropriate metadata for tracking and management

The test confirms that the RFI phase workflow is functioning correctly.
